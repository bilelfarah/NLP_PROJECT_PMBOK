      "KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "Project scheduling provides a detailed plan that represents how and when the project will deliver the products,\n",
      "services, and results defined in the project scope and serves as a tool for communication, managing stakeholders’\n",
      "expectations, and as a basis for performance reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project management team selects a scheduling method, such as critical path or an agile approach. Then, the\n",
      "project-specific data, such as the activities, planned dates, durations, resources, dependencies, and constraints, are\n",
      "entered into a scheduling tool to create a schedule model for the project. The result is a project schedule. Figure 6-2\n",
      "provides a scheduling overview that shows how the scheduling method, scheduling tool, and outputs from the Project\n",
      "Schedule Management processes interact to create a schedule model.\n",
      "\n",
      "For smaller projects, defining activities, sequencing activities, estimating activity durations, and developing the\n",
      "schedule model are so tightly linked that they are viewed as a single process that can be performed by a person\n",
      "over a relatively short period of time. These processes are presented here as distinct elements because the tools and\n",
      "techniques for each process are different. Some of these processes are presented more fully in the Practice Standard\n",
      "for Scheduling [2].\n",

      "When possible, the detailed project schedule should remain flexible throughout the project to adjust for knowledge\n",

      "TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "With high levels of uncertainty and unpredictability in a fast-paced, highly competitive global marketplace where\n",
      "long term scope is difficult to define, it is becoming even more important to have a contextual framework for effective\n",
      "adoption and tailoring of development practices to respond to the changing needs of the environment. Adaptive\n",
      "planning defines a plan but acknowledges that once work starts, the priorities may change and the plan needs to\n",
      "reflect this new knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the emerging practices for project scheduling methods include but are not limited to:\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Iterative scheduling with a backlog. This is a form of rolling wave planning based on adaptive life cycles,\n",
      "such as the agile approach for product development. The requirements are documented in user stories that are\n",
      "then prioritized and refined just prior to construction, and the product features are developed using time-boxed\n",
      "periods of work. This approach is often used to deliver incremental value to the customer or when multiple\n",
      "teams can concurrently develop a large number of features that have few interconnected dependencies. This\n",
      "scheduling method is appropriate for many projects as indicated by the widespread and growing use of adaptive\n",
      "life cycles for product development. The benefit of this approach is that it welcomes changes throughout the\n",
      "development life cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "@ On-demand scheduling. This approach, typically used in a Kanban system, is based on the theory-of-\n",
      "constraints and pull-based scheduling concepts from lean manufacturing to limit a team’s work in progress\n",
      "in order to balance demand against the team’s delivery throughput. On-demand scheduling does not rely\n",
      "on a schedule that was developed previously for the development of the product or product increments,\n",
      "but rather pulls work from a backlog or intermediate queue of work to be done immediately as resources\n",
      "become available. On-demand scheduling is often used for projects that evolve the product incrementally in\n",
      "operational or sustainment environments, and where tasks may be made relatively similar in size and scope\n",
      "or can be bundled by size and scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "177\n",
      "TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Schedule Management\n",
      "processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Life cycle approach. What is the most appropriate life cycle approach that allows for a more detailed schedule?\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Resource availability. What are the factors influencing durations (such as the correlation between available\n",
      "resources and their productivity)?\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Project dimensions. How will the presence of project complexity, technological uncertainty, product novelty,\n",
      "pace, or progress tracking (such as earned value, percentage complete, red-yellow-green (stop light) indicators)\n",
      "impact the desired level of control?\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Technology support. Is technology used to develop, record, transmit, receive, and store project schedule model\n",
      "information and is it readily accessible?\n",
      "\n",
      "For more specific information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling [16].\n",
      "\n",
      "CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "Adaptive approaches use short cycles to undertake work, review the results, and adapt as necessary. These\n",
      "cycles provide rapid feedback on the approaches and suitability of deliverables, and generally manifest as iterative\n",
      "scheduling and on-demand, pull-based scheduling, as discussed in the section on Key Trends and Emerging Practices\n",
      "in Project Schedule Management.\n",
      "\n",
      "In large organizations, there may be a mixture of small projects and large initiatives requiring long-term roadmaps\n",
      "to manage the development of these programs using scaling factors (e.g., team size, geographical distribution,\n",
      "regulatory compliance, organizational complexity, and technical complexity). To address the full delivery life cycle for\n",
      "larger, enterprise-wide systems, a range of techniques utilizing a predictive approach, adaptive approach, or a hybrid\n",
      "of both, may need to be adopted. The organization may need to combine practices from several core methods, or\n",
      "adopt a method that has already done so, and adopt a few principles and practices of more traditional techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "The role of the project manager does not change based on managing projects using a predictive development life\n",
      "cycle or managing projects in adaptive environments. However, to be successful in using adaptive approaches, the\n",

      "TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "With high levels of uncertainty and unpredictability in a fast-paced, highly competitive global marketplace where\n",
      "long term scope is difficult to define, it is becoming even more important to have a contextual framework for effective\n",
      "adoption and tailoring of development practices to respond to the changing needs of the environment. Adaptive\n",
      "planning defines a plan but acknowledges that once work starts, the priorities may change and the plan needs to\n",
      "reflect this new knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the emerging practices for project scheduling methods include but are not limited to:\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Iterative scheduling with a backlog. This is a form of rolling wave planning based on adaptive life cycles,\n",
      "such as the agile approach for product development. The requirements are documented in user stories that are\n",
      "then prioritized and refined just prior to construction, and the product features are developed using time-boxed\n",
      "periods of work. This approach is often used to deliver incremental value to the customer or when multiple\n",
      "teams can concurrently develop a large number of features that have few interconnected dependencies. This\n",
      "scheduling method is appropriate for many projects as indicated by the widespread and growing use of adaptive\n",
      "life cycles for product development. The benefit of this approach is that it welcomes changes throughout the\n",
      "development life cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "@ On-demand scheduling. This approach, typically used in a Kanban system, is based on the theory-of-\n",
      "constraints and pull-based scheduling concepts from lean manufacturing to limit a team’s work in progress\n",
      "in order to balance demand against the team’s delivery throughput. On-demand scheduling does not rely\n",
      "on a schedule that was developed previously for the development of the product or product increments,\n",
      "but rather pulls work from a backlog or intermediate queue of work to be done immediately as resources\n",
      "become available. On-demand scheduling is often used for projects that evolve the product incrementally in\n",
      "operational or sustainment environments, and where tasks may be made relatively similar in size and scope\n",
      "or can be bundled by size and scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "177\n",
      "TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Schedule Management\n",
      "processes are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Life cycle approach. What is the most appropriate life cycle approach that allows for a more detailed schedule?\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Resource availability. What are the factors influencing durations (such as the correlation between available\n",
      "resources and their productivity)?\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Project dimensions. How will the presence of project complexity, technological uncertainty, product novelty,\n",
      "pace, or progress tracking (such as earned value, percentage complete, red-yellow-green (stop light) indicators)\n",
      "impact the desired level of control?\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Technology support. Is technology used to develop, record, transmit, receive, and store project schedule model\n",
      "information and is it readily accessible?\n",

      "\n",

      "regulatory compliance, organizational complexity, and technical complexity). To address the full delivery life cycle for\n",
      "larger, enterprise-wide systems, a range of techniques utilizing a predictive approach, adaptive approach, or a hybrid\n",
      "of both, may need to be adopted. The organization may need to combine practices from several core methods, or\n",
      "adopt a method that has already done so, and adopt a few principles and practices of more traditional techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "The role of the project manager does not change based on managing projects using a predictive development life\n",

      "example, the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and therefore the sequence of A-C-D is the critical path.\n",

       "'PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT\\nProject Schedule Management includes the processes required to manage the timely completion of the project.\\nThe Project Schedule Management processes are:\\n\\n6.1 Plan Schedule Management—The process of establishing the policies, procedures, and documentation for\\nplanning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the project schedule.\\n\\n6.2 Define Activities—The process of identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to produce\\nthe project deliverables.\\n\\n6.3 Sequence Activities—The process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities.\\n\\n6.4 Estimate Activity Durations—The process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete\\nindividual activities with the estimated resources.\\n\\n6.5 Develop Schedule—The process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and\\nschedule constraints to create the project schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling.\\n\\n6.6 Control Schedule—The process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule andanage changes to the schedule baseline.\\n\\nFigure 61 provides an overview of the Project Schedule Management processes. The Project Schedule Management\\nprocesses are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces while, in practice, they overlap and interact in\\nways that cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK® Guide.\\n\\n173\\n174\\n\\n\\nKEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT\\n\\nProject scheduling provides a detailed plan that represents how and when the project will deliver the products,\\nservices, and results defined in the project scope and serves as a tool for communication, managing stakeholders’\\nexpectations, and as a basis for performance reporting.\\n\\nThe project management team selects a scheduling method, such as critical path or an agile approach. Then, the\\nprojectspecific data, such as the activities, planned dates, durations, resources, dependencies, and constraints, are\\nentered into a scheduling tool to create a schedule model for the project. The result is a project schedule. Figure 62\\nprovides a scheduling overview that shows how the scheduling method, scheduling tool, and outputs from the Project\\nSchedule Management processes interact to create a schedule model.\\n\\nFor smaller projects, defining activities, sequencing activities, estimating activity durations, and developing the\\nschedule model are so tightly linked that they are viewed as a single process that can be performed by a personver a relatively short period of time. These processes are presented here as distinct elements because the tools and\\ntechniques for each process are different. Some of these processes are presented more fully in the Practice Standard\\nfor Scheduling [2].\\n\\nWhen possible, the detailed project schedule should remain flexible throughout the project to adjust for knowledge\\ngained, increased understanding of the risk, and valueadded activities.\\n\\n175\\n176\\n\\n\\nTRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT\\n\\nWith high levels of uncertainty and unpredictability in a fastpaced, highly competitive global marketplace where\\nlong term scope is difficult to define, it is becoming even more important to have a contextual framework for effective\\nadoption and tailoring of development practices to respond to the changing needs of the environment. Adaptive\\nplanning defines a plan but acknowledges that once work starts, the priorities may change and the plan needs to\\nreflect this new knowledge.\\n\\nSome of the emerging practices for project scheduling methods include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Iterative scheduling with a backlog. This is a form of rolling wave planning based on adaptive life cycles,\\nsuch as the agile approach for product development. The requirements are documented in user stories that are\\nthen prioritized and refined just prior to construction, and the product features are developed using timeboxed\\nperiods of work. This approach is often used to deliver incremental value to the customer or when multiple\\nteams can concurrently develop a large number of features that have few interconnected dependencies. This\\nscheduling method is appropriate for many projects as indicated by the widespread and growing use of adaptive\\nlife cycles for product development. The benefit of this approach is that it welcomes changes throughout the\\ndevelopment life cycle.\\n\\n Ondemand scheduling. This approach, typically used in a Kanban system, is based on the theoryof\\nconstraints and pullbased scheduling concepts from lean manufacturing to limit a team’s work in progress\\nin order to balance demand against the team’s delivery throughput. Ondemand scheduling does not relyn a schedule that was developed previously for the development of the product or product increments,\\nbut rather pulls work from a backlog or intermediate queue of work to be done immediately as resources\\nbecome available. Ondemand scheduling is often used for projects that evolve the product incrementally inperational or sustainment environments, and where tasks may be made relatively similar in size and scoper can be bundled by size and scope.\\n\\n177\\nTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\n\\nBecause each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Schedule Management\\nprocesses are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Life cycle approach. What is the most appropriate life cycle approach that allows for a more detailed schedule?\\n\\n Resource availability. What are the factors influencing durations (such as the correlation between available\\nresources and their productivity)?\\n\\n Project dimensions. How will the presence of project complexity, technological uncertainty, product novelty,\\npace, or progress tracking (such as earned value, percentage complete, redyellowgreen (stop light) indicators)\\nimpact the desired level of control?\\n\\n Technology support. Is technology used to develop, record, transmit, receive, and store project schedule model\\ninformation and is it readily accessible?\\n\\nFor more specific information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling [16].\\n\\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\\n\\nAdaptive approaches use short cycles to undertake work, review the results, and adapt as necessary. These\\ncycles provide rapid feedback on the approaches and suitability of deliverables, and generally manifest as iterative\\nscheduling and ondemand, pullbased scheduling, as discussed in the section on Key Trends and Emerging Practices\\nin Project Schedule Management.\\n\\nIn large organizations, there may be a mixture of small projects and large initiatives requiring longterm roadmaps\\nto manage the development of these programs using scaling factors (e.g., team size, geographical distribution,\\nregulatory compliance, organizational complexity, and technical complexity). To address the full delivery life cycle for\\nlarger, enterprisewide systems, a range of techniques utilizing a predictive approach, adaptive approach, or a hybridf both, may need to be adopted. The organization may need to combine practices from several core methods, or\\nadopt a method that has already done so, and adopt a few principles and practices of more traditional techniques.\\n\\nThe role of the project manager does not change based on managing projects using a predictive development life\\ncycle or managing projects in adaptive environments. However, to be successful in using adaptive approaches, the\\nproject manager will need to be familiar with the tools and techniques to understand how to apply them effectively.\\n\\n178 \\n6.1 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT\\n\\nPlan Schedule Management is the process of establishing the policies, procedures, and documentation for\\nplanning, developing, managing, executing, and controlling the project schedule. The key benefit of this process is\\nthat it provides guidance and direction on how the project schedule will be managed throughout the project. This\\nprocess is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of the\\nprocess are depicted in Figure 63. Figure 64 depicts the data flow diagram for the process.\\n\\n179\\n6.1.1 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: INPUTS\\n\\n6.1.1.1 PROJECT CHARTER\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter defines the summary milestone schedule that will influence theanagement of the project schedule.\\n\\n6.1.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan describes how the scope\\nwill be defined and developed, which will provide information on how the schedule will be developed.\\n\\n Development approach. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The product development approach will help define the\\nscheduling approach, estimating techniques, scheduling tools, and techniques for controlling the schedule.\\n\\n6.1.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Organizational culture and structure,\\n Team resource availability and skills and physical resource availability,\\n Scheduling software,\\n\\n Guidelines and criteria for tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes and procedures to satisfy the\\nspecific needs of the project, and\\n\\n Commercial databases, such as standardized estimating data.\\n\\n6.1.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Historical information and lessons learned repositories;\\n\\n Existing formal and informal schedule development, management and controlrelated policies, procedures,\\nand guidelines;\\n\\n Templates and forms; and\\n\\n Monitoring and reporting tools.\\n\\n180 \\n6.1.2 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in previous, similar projects:\\n\\n Schedule development, management, and control;\\n Scheduling methodologies (e.g., predictive or adaptive life cycle);\\n Scheduling software; and\\n\\n The specific industry for which the project is developed.\\n\\n6.1.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nA data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.\\nAlternatives analysis can include determining which schedule methodology to use, or how to combine variousethods on the project. It can also include determining how detailed the schedule needs to be, the duration of\\nwaves for rolling wave planning, and how often it should be reviewed and updated. An appropriate balance between\\nthe level of detail needed to manage the schedule and the amount of time it takes to keep it up to date needs to be\\nreached for each project.\\n\\n6.1.2.3 MEETINGS\\n\\nProject teams may hold planning meetings to develop the schedule management plan. Participants at these meetingsay include the project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone\\nwith responsibility for schedule planning or execution, and others as needed.\\n\\n6.1.3 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.1.3.1 SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nThe schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteria\\nand the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management plan may be\\nformal or informal, highly detailed, or broadly framed based on the needs of the project, and includes appropriate\\ncontrol thresholds.\\n\\n181\\nThe schedule management plan can establish the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProject schedule model development. The scheduling methodology and the scheduling tool to be used in the\\ndevelopment of the project schedule model are specified.\\n\\nRelease and iteration length. When using an adaptive life cycle, the timeboxed periods for releases, waves,\\nand iterations are specified. Timeboxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily toward\\ncompletion of a goal. Timeboxing helps to minimize scope creep as it forces the teams to process essential\\nfeatures first, then other features when time permits.\\n\\nLevel of accuracy. The level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining realistic activity\\nduration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies.\\n\\nUnits of measure. Each unit of measurement (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures, oreters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures) is defined for each of the resources.\\n\\nOrganizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the framework\\nfor the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates and resulting schedules.\\n\\nProject schedule model maintenance. The process used to update the status and record progress of the\\nproject in the schedule model during the execution of the project is defined.\\n\\nControl thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be specified to indicate an\\nagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically\\nexpressed as percentage deviations from the parameters established in the baseline plan.\\n\\nRules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules or other physical measurement\\nrules of performance measurement are set. For example, the schedule management plan may specify: Rules for establishing percent complete,\\n EVM techniques (e.g., baselines, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to be employed (for more specific\\ninformation, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value Management [17]), and\\n Schedule performance measurements such as schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI)\\nused to assess the magnitude of variation to the original schedule baseline.\\n\\nReporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined.\\n\\n182\\n\\n\\n6.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIES\\n\\nDefine Activities is the process of identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to produce\\nthe project deliverables. The key benefit of this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activities\\nthat provide a basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, monitoring, and controlling the project work. This process\\nis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in\\nFigure 65. Figure 66 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n183\\n6.2.1 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS\\n\\n6.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the\\nschedule methodology, the duration of waves for rolling wave planning, and the level of detail necessary toanage the work.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions\\ndocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while defining activities.\\n6.2.1.2 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\nEnterprise environmental factors that influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to:\\n Organizational cultures and structure,\\n\\n Published commercial information from commercial databases, and\\n\\n Project management information system (PMIS).\\n\\n6.2.1.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to:\\n Lessons learned repository containing historical information regarding activity lists used by previous similar projects,\\n Standardized processes,\\n Templates that contain a standard activity list or a portion of an activity list from a previous project, and\\n\\n Existing formal and informal activity planningrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the schedulingethodology, that are considered in developing the activity definitions.\\n\\n6.2.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledgef similar past projects and the work being performed.\\n\\n184 \\n6.2.2.2 DECOMPOSITION\\n\\nDescribed in Section 5.4.2.2. Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and\\nproject deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. Activities represent the effort needed to complete a work\\npackage. The Define Activities process defines the final outputs as activities rather than deliverables, as done in the\\nCreate WBS process (Section 5.4).\\n\\nThe activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently, with the WBS and WBS\\ndictionary used as the basis for development of the final activity list. Each work package within the WBS is decomposed\\ninto the activities required to produce the work package deliverables. Involving team members in the decomposition can\\nlead to better and more accurate results.\\n\\n6.2.2.3 ROLLING WAVE PLANNING\\n\\nRolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is\\nplanned in detail, while work further in the future is planned at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaboration\\napplicable to work packages, planning packages, and release planning when using an agile or waterfall approach.\\nTherefore, work can exist at various levels of detail depending on where it is in the project life cycle. During early\\nstrategic planning when information is less defined, work packages may be decomposed to the known level of detail. Asore is known about the upcoming events in the near term, work packages can be decomposed into activities.\\n\\n6.2.2.4 MEETINGS\\n\\nMeetings may be facetoface, virtual, formal, or informal. Meetings may be held with team members or subjectatter experts to define the activities needed to complete the work.\\n\\n6.2.3 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.2.3.1 ACTIVITY LIST\\n\\nThe activity list includes the schedule activities required on the project. For projects that use rolling wave planningr agile techniques, the activity list will be updated periodically as the project progresses. The activity list includes\\nan activity identifier and a scope of work description for each activity in sufficient detail to ensure that project teamembers understand what work is required to be completed.\\n\\n185\\n6.2.3.2 ACTIVITY ATTRIBUTES\\n\\nActivity attributes extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated with each\\nactivity. The components for each activity evolve over time. During the initial stages of the project, they include\\nthe unique activity identifier (ID), WBS ID, and activity label or name. When completed, they may include activity\\ndescriptions, predecessor activities, successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags (Section 6.3.2.3),\\nresource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify the\\nplace where the work has to be performed, the project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effort\\ninvolved. Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the planned\\nschedule activities in various ways within reports\\n\\n6.2.3.3 MILESTONE LIST\\n\\nA milestone is a significant point or event in a project. A milestone list identifies all project milestones and indicates\\nwhether the milestone is mandatory, such as those required by contract, or optional, such as those based on historical\\ninformation. Milestones have zero duration because they represent a significant point or event.\\n\\n6.2.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Once the project has been baselined, the progressive elaboration of deliverables into\\nactivities may reveal work that was not initially part of the project baselines. This may result in a change request.\\nChange requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process\\n(Section 4.6).\\n\\n6.2.3.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change\\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Throughout the project, work packages are progressively\\nelaborated into activities. This process may reveal work that was not part of the initial schedule baseline,\\nnecessitating a change to delivery dates or other significant schedule milestones that are part of the\\nschedule baseline.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to\\napproved changes in schedule activities.\\n\\n186 \\n6.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES\\n\\nSequence Activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities. The key\\nbenefit of this process is that it defines the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efficiency given all project\\nconstraints. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this\\nprocess are depicted in Figure 67. Figure 68 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n187\\nEvery activity except the first and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successor\\nactivity with an appropriate logical relationship. Logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic project\\nschedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable project\\nschedule. Sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automated\\ntechniques. The Sequence Activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram to\\nact as a first step to publish the schedule baseline.\\n\\n6.3.1 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS\\n\\n6.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the method\\nused and the level of accuracy along with other criteria required to sequence activities.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions\\ndocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while sequencing activities.\\n\\n6.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of\\nevents or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships\\nbetween the activities.\\n\\n Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the project\\nthat are to be sequenced. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence the sequencingf the activities.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may\\ninfluence the way activities are sequenced, the relationship between activities, and the need for leads and lags,\\nand may give rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.\\n\\n Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestones,\\nwhich may influence the way activities are sequenced.\\n\\n188 \\n6.3.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to:\\n Government or industry standards,\\n Project management information system (PMIS),\\n Scheduling tools, and\\n\\n Organization work authorization systems.\\n\\n6.3.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Portfolio and program plans and project dependencies and relationships;\\n\\n Existing formal and informal activity planningrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the schedulingethodology that is considered in developing logical relationships;\\n\\n Templates that can be used to expedite the preparation of networks for project activities. Related activity attributes\\ninformation in templates can also contain additional descriptive information useful in sequencing activities; and\\n\\n Lessons learned repository containing historical information that can help optimize the sequencing process.\\n\\n6.3.2 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.3.2.1 PRECEDENCE DIAGRAMMING METHOD\\n\\nThe precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities\\nare represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which\\nthe activities are to be performed.\\n\\nPDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that logically\\ncomes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after\\nanother activity in a schedule. These relationships are defined below and are illustrated in Figure 69:\\n\\n189\\n Finishtostart (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity\\nhas finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardware\\nis assembled (predecessor).\\n\\n Finishtofinish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity\\nhas finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to finish before editing the document\\n(successor) can finish.\\n\\n Starttostart (). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity\\nhas started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins.\\n\\n Starttofinish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity\\nhas started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) has to start before the old accounts\\npayable system can be shut down (predecessor).\\n\\nIn PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, but\\nis included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.\\n\\nTwo activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example,  and FF). Multiple relationships\\nbetween the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the\\nhighest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.\\n\\n190 \\n6.3.2.2 DEPENDENCY DETERMINATION AND INTEGRATION\\n\\nDependencies may be characterized by the following attributes: mandatory or discretionary, internal or external\\n(as described below). Dependency has four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the following\\nways: mandatory external dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, or\\ndiscretionary internal dependencies.\\n\\n Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required or\\ninherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations, such as on a\\nconstruction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built,r on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependencies\\nare sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory.\\nThe project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities.\\nMandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool.\\n\\n Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic,\\npreferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best\\npractices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequence\\nis desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted best\\npractices recommend that during construction, the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbing\\nwork. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performing\\nthe activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fully\\ndocumented since they can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling options. When fast\\ntracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered forodification or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the processf sequencing the activities.\\n\\n191\\n External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and non\\nproject activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control. For example, the\\ntesting activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, or\\ngovernmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction\\nproject. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of\\nsequencing the activities.\\n\\n Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and\\nare generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assemble\\nit, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependencies\\nare internal during the process of sequencing the activities.\\n\\n6.3.2.3 LEADS AND LAGS\\n\\nA lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,n a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduled\\npunch list completion. This would be shown as a finishtostart with a 2week lead as shown in Figure 610. Lead is often\\nrepresented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.\\n\\n192 \\nA lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,\\na technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can be\\nshown as a starttostart relationship with a 15day lag as shown in Figure 610. Lag can also be represented in project\\nschedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 611 in the relationship between activities H and / (as indicated by the\\nnomenclature +10 (starttostart plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale).\\n\\nThe project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately define the\\nlogical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Also, duration estimates do not include\\nany leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions should be documented.\\n\\n6.3.2.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems includes scheduling software that has the\\ncapability to help plan, organize, and adjust the sequence of the activities; insert the logical relationships, lead and lag\\nvalues; and differentiate the different types of dependencies.\\n\\n193\\n6.3.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.3.3.1 PROJECT SCHEDULE NETWORK DIAGRAMS\\n\\nA project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to as\\ndependencies, among the project schedule activities. Figure 611 illustrates a project schedule network diagram. A\\nproject schedule network diagram is produced manually or by using project management software. It can include full\\nproject details, or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describe\\nthe basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fully\\ndescribed within the narrative.\\n\\nActivities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have multiple successor\\nactivities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence are at greater risk as they are affected\\nby multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity | is called a path convergence, as it has more than one\\npredecessor, while activity K is called a path divergence, as it has more than one successor.\\n\\n6.3.3.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of\\nevents or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships\\nbetween the activities.\\n\\n Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list may be impacted by the change in relationships\\namong the project activities during the sequencing activities.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may\\nneed to be updated based on the sequencing, relationship determination, and leads and lags, and may give rise\\nto individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.\\n\\n Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The scheduled dates for specific milestones may be impacted by\\nchanges in relationships among the project activities during the sequencing activities.\\n\\n194 \\n6.4 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS\\n\\nEstimate Activity Durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual\\nactivities with estimated resources. The key benefit of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activity\\nwill take to complete. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of\\nthis process are depicted in Figure 612. Figure 613 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n195\\nEstimating activity durations uses information from the scope of work, required resource types or skill levels,\\nestimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may influence the duration estimates include\\nconstraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., fixed duration, fixed effort or work, fixed\\nnumber of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of durationriginate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the specific\\nactivity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of the\\ninput data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work,\\nthe accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.\\n\\n196 \\nThe Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete\\nthe activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity. These estimates are used to\\napproximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project\\nand resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an\\nactivity, along with the skill proficiency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a driving\\nresource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple “straightline” or\\nlinear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved,r number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation\\n(e.g., a 24hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include:\\n\\n Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce a\\nunit of work is increased while all other factors remain fixed, a point will eventually be reached at which additionsf that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output.\\n\\n Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does\\nnot always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point adding\\ntoo many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additional\\ncoordination, and other factors involved.\\n\\n Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, an\\nincrease in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology,\\nwhich may impact duration and resource needs.\\n\\n Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—or procrastination—\\nwhen people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Law\\nwhere work expands to fill the time available for its completion.\\n\\nAll data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate.\\n\\n197\\n6.4.1 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: INPUTS\\n\\n6.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the method\\nused, as well as the level of accuracy and other criteria required to estimate activity durations.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the WBS dictionary, which contains\\ntechnical details that can influence the effort and duration estimates.\\n\\n6.4.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\n\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe defined predecessor or\\nsuccessor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships between the activities that may\\nimpact duration estimates.\\n\\n Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the\\nproject, which are to be estimated. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence the\\nduration estimates.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may\\ngive rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to\\neffort and duration estimating can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precisionf effort and duration estimates.\\n\\n Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestones\\nthat may impact the duration estimates.\\n\\n Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project is staffed when the appropriate people\\nhave been assigned to the team.\\n\\n Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. The resource breakdown structure provides a\\nhierarchical structure of the identified resources by resource category and resource type.\\n\\n198 \\n Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars influence the duration of schedule\\nactivities due to the availability of specific resources, type of resources, and resources with specific attributes.\\nResource calendars specify when and how long identified project resources will be available during the project.\\n\\n Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The estimated activity resource requirements will have\\nan effect on the duration of the activity, since the level to which the resources assigned to the activity meet\\nthe requirements will significantly influence the duration of most activities. For example, if additional or lower\\nskilled resources are assigned to an activity, there may be reduced efficiency or productivity due to increased\\ncommunication, training, and coordination needs leading to a longer duration estimate.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Individual project risks may impact resource selection and\\navailability. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates, described in Section\\n11.5.3.2, from Plan Risk Responses.\\n\\n6.4.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Duration estimating databases and other reference data,\\n Productivity metrics,\\n Published commercial information, and\\n\\n Location of team members.\\n\\n6.4.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Historical duration information,\\n Project calendars,\\n\\n Estimating policies,\\n\\n Scheduling methodology, and\\n\\n Lessons learned repository.\\n\\n199\\n6.4.2 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics:\\n\\n Schedule development, management, and control;\\n Expertise in estimating; and\\n\\n Discipline or application knowledge.\\n\\n6.4.2.2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING\\n\\nAnalogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical\\ndata from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as\\nduration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future\\nproject. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basis\\nfor estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known\\ndifferences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when\\nthere is a limited amount of detailed information about the project.\\n\\nAnalogous estimating is generally less costly and less timeconsuming than other techniques, but it is also\\nless accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may\\nbe used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous\\nactivities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates\\nhave the needed expertise.\\n\\n6.4.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING\\n\\nParametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration basedn historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data\\nand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost,\\nbudget, and duration.\\n\\n200 \\nDurations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor\\nhours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by\\nthe number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor\\nhours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required to\\ninstall 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).\\n\\nThis technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into\\nthe model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction\\nwith other estimating methods.\\n\\n6.4.2.4 THREEPOINT ESTIMATING\\n\\nThe accuracy of singlepoint duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk.\\nUsing threepoint estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity’s duration:\\n\\n Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned,\\ntheir productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and\\ninterruptions.\\n\\n Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity.\\n Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.\\n\\nDepending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE,\\ncan be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:\\n\\ntE (tO + iM + tP)/ 3.\\n\\nTriangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental data. Duration\\nestimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range of\\nuncertainty around the expected duration.\\n\\n201\\n6.4.2.5 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATING\\n\\nBottomu\\n\\np estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower\\n\\nlevel components of the WBS. When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence,\\n\\nthe work wi\\n\\nhin the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates are\\n\\nthen aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependencies\\n\\nbetween the\\nusage is ref\\n that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resource\\nlected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity.\\n\\n6.4.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData ana\\n\\nlysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills;\\nscheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated);\\nand make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, and\\nduration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work.\\n\\n Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserve\\nneeded for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedule\\nreserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedule\\nbaseline, which is allocated for identified risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with the\\nknownunknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingency\\nreserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a fixed number of work periods. Contingency\\nreserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about the\\nproject becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be\\nclearly identified in the schedule documentation.\\n\\nEstimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Management\\nreserves are a specified amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are\\nreserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address\\nthe unknownunknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline,\\nbut it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of management\\nreserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.\\n\\n202 \\n6.4.2.7 DECISION MAKING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 5.2.2.4. Decisionmaking techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limited\\nto voting. One variation of the voting method that is often used in agilebased projects is called the fist of five (also called\\nfist to five). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding\\nup a closed fist (indicating no support) up to five fingers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer than\\nthree fingers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project manager\\ncontinues the fistoffive process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more fingers) or agrees\\nto move on to the next decision.\\n\\n6.4.2.8 MEETINGS\\n\\nThe project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessary\\nto conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decide\\nwhich of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to low\\nlevel tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacityver the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the first day of the iteration and is attended by the productwner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well as\\nassumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions.\\n\\n6.4.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.4.3.1 DURATION ESTIMATES\\n\\nDuration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to complete\\nan activity, a phase, or a project. Duration estimates do not include any lags as described in Section 6.3.2.3. Duration\\nestimates may include some indication of the range of possible results. For example:\\n\\n A range of 2 weeks + 2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and not more than 12\\n(assuming a 5day work week); or\\n\\n A 15% probability of exceeding 3 weeks, which indicates a high probability—85%—that the activity will take\\n3 weeks or less.\\n\\n203\\n6.4.3.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATES\\n\\nThe amount and type of additional details supporting the duration estimate vary by application area. Regardless of\\nthe level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the duration\\nestimate was derived.\\n\\nSupporting detail for duration estimates may include:\\n\\n Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed),\\n Documentation of all assumptions made,\\n\\n Documentation of any known constraints,\\n\\n Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., +10%) to indicate that the duration is estimated between a\\nrange of values),\\n\\n Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate, and\\n\\n Documentation of individual project risks influencing this estimate.\\n\\n6.4.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity duration estimates produced during this process are\\ndocumented as part of the activity attributes.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. This includes assumptions made in developing the duration\\nestimate, such as resource skill levels and availability, as well as a basis of estimates for durations. Additionally,\\nconstraints arising out of the scheduling methodology and scheduling tool are also documented.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with\\ntechniques that were efficient and effective in developing effort and duration estimates.\\n\\n204 \\n6.5 DEVELOP SCHEDULE\\n\\nDevelop Schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule\\nconstraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling. The key benefit of this\\nprocess is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities. This process\\nis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in\\nFigure 614. Figure 615 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n205\\n206 \\nDeveloping an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The schedule model is used to determine the\\nplanned start and finish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information. Schedule\\ndevelopment can require the review and revision of duration estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves to\\nestablish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress. Key steps include defining the\\nproject milestones, identifying and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and finish\\ndates have been determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assigned\\nactivities. The staff confirms that the start and finish dates present no conflict with resource calendars or assigned\\nactivities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed to determine conflicts with\\nlogical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined. Revising andaintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project,\\nas described in Section 6.7.\\n\\nFor more specific information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling.\\n\\n6.5.1 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: INPUTS\\n\\n6.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan identifies the\\nscheduling method and tool used to create the schedule and how the schedule is to be calculated.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary have details about\\nthe project deliverables that are considered when building the schedule model.\\n\\n6.5.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. The activity attributes provide the details used to build the\\nschedule model.\\n\\n Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list identifies the activities that will be included in the\\nschedule model.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may\\ngive rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.\\n\\n207\\n Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. The amount and type of additional details supporting the\\nduration estimate vary by application area. Regardless of the level of detail, the supporting documentation should\\nprovide a clear and complete understanding of how the duration estimate was derived.\\n\\n Duration estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.1. The duration estimates contain the quantitative assessmentsf the likely number of work periods that will be required to complete an activity. This will be used to calculate\\nthe schedule.\\n\\n Lessons learned. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to developing\\nthe schedule model can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the validity of the schedule model.\\n\\n Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list has scheduled dates for specific milestones.\\n\\n Project schedule network diagrams. Described in Section 6.3.3.1. The project schedule network diagrams\\ncontain the logical relationships of predecessors and successors that will be used to calculate the schedule.\\n\\n Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project team assignments specify which resources\\nare assigned to each activity.\\n\\n Resource calendars. Described in Sections 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars contain information on the\\navailability of resources during the project.\\n\\n Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The activity resource requirements identify the types and\\nquantities of resources required for each activity used to create the schedule model.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register provides the details of all identified risks, and their\\ncharacteristics, that affect the schedule model. Risk information relevant to the schedule is reflected in schedule\\nreserves using the expected or mean risk impact.\\n\\n6.5.1.3 AGREEMENTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 12.2.3.2. Vendors may have an input to the project schedule as they develop the details of how\\nthey will perform the project work to meet contractual commitments.\\n\\n208 \\n6.5.1.4 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Develop Schedule process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Government or industry standards, and\\n\\n Communication channels.\\n\\n6.5.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Develop Schedule process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Scheduling methodology containing the policies governing schedule model development and maintenance,\\nand\\n\\n Project calendar(s).\\n\\n6.5.2 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.5.2.1 SCHEDULE NETWORK ANALYSIS\\n\\nSchedule network analysis is the overarching technique used to generate the project schedule model. It employs\\nseveral other techniques such as critical path method (described in Section 6.5.2.2), resource optimization techniques\\n(described in Section 6.5.2.3), and modeling techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.4). Additional analysis includes but\\nis not limited to:\\n\\n Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiple\\npaths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time, to reduce the\\nprobability of a schedule slip.\\n\\n Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has highrisk activities or long lead items that would necessitate\\nuse of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path.\\n\\nSchedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed.\\n\\n209\\n6.5.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD\\n\\nThe critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule\\nflexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. This schedule network analysis technique calculates\\nthe early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations\\nby performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 616. In this\\nexample, the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and therefore the sequence of ACD is the critical path.\\nThe critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines\\nthe shortest possible project duration. The longest path has the least total float—usually zero. The resulting early\\nand late start and finish dates are not necessarily the project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods within\\nwhich the activity could be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logical\\nrelationships, leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path(s)\\nand the amount of total and free float or schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.\\n\\nOn any network path, the total float or schedule flexibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule\\nactivity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date or violating a\\nschedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total float on the critical path. As implemented\\nwith the precedence diagramming method sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total float\\ndepending on the constraints applied. Positive total float is caused when the backward pass is calculated from a\\nschedule constraint that is later than the early finish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation.\\nNegative total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative float\\nanalysis is a technique that helps to find possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track.\\nSchedule networks may have multiple nearcritical paths. Many software packages allow the user to define the\\nparameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments to activity durations (when more resources or less\\nscope can be arranged), logical relationships (when the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads and\\nlags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total float.\\nOnce the total float and the free float have been calculated, the free float is the amount of time that a schedule\\nactivity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. For\\nexample the free float for Activity B, in Figure 616, is 5 days.\\n\\n210 \\n6.5.2.3 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION\\n\\nResource optimization is used to adjust the start and finish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to be\\nequal to or less than resource availability. Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the\\nschedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Resource leveling. A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with\\nthe goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used when\\nshared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are over\\nallocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (as\\nshown in Figure 617), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can often\\ncause the original critical path to change. Available float is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the critical\\npath through the project schedule may change.\\n\\n Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for\\nresources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed to\\nresource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In other\\nwords, activities may only be delayed within their free and total float. Resource smoothing may not be able toptimize all resources.\\n\\n211\\n212 \\n6.5.2.4 DATA ANALYSIS\\nData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Whatif scenario analysis. Whatif scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict\\ntheir effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, “What if the situation\\nrepresented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to compute\\nthe different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending specific engineering durations,r introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the whatif\\nscenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and in\\npreparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations.\\n\\n Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty\\nto evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique is\\nMonte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate\\npossible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating multiple work package durations\\nwith different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributions\\nand other representations of uncertainty (see Section 11.4.2.4). Figure 618 shows a probability distribution for a\\nproject with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project finish date). In this example, there is a\\n10% probability that the project will finish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probabilityf completing the project by May 28.\\n\\n213\\nFor more information on how Monte Carlo simulation is used for schedule models, see the Practice Standard\\nfor Scheduling.\\n\\n6.5.2.5 LEADS AND LAGS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.3.2.3. Leads and lags are refinements applied during network analysis to develop a viable\\nschedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. Leads are used in limited circumstances to advance a\\nsuccessor activity with respect to the predecessor activity, and lags are used in limited circumstances where processes\\nrequire a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact.\\n\\n214 \\n6.5.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREION\\n\\nSchedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing the\\nproject scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful technique\\nis the negative float analysis. The critical path is the one with the least float. Due to violating a constraint or imposed\\ndate, the total float can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 619 and include:\\n\\n Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.\\nExamples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery\\nto activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources\\nwill shorten the activity’s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in\\nincreased risk and/or cost.\\n\\n Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence\\nare performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a\\nbuilding before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increased\\nrisk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical\\npath. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities\\nconcerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.\\n\\n215\\n6.5.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that expedites\\nthe process of building a schedule model by generating start and finish dates based on the inputs of activities, network\\ndiagrams, resources, and activity durations.\\n\\n6.5.2.8 AGILE RELEASE PLANNING\\n\\nAgile release planning provides a highlevel summary timeline of the release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months)\\nbased on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product’s evolution. Agile release planning also\\ndetermines the number of iterations or sprints in the release, and allows the product owner and team to decide\\nhow much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals,\\ndependencies, and impediments.\\n\\nSince features represent value to the customer, the timeline provides a more easily understood project schedule\\nas it defines which feature will be available at the end of each iteration, which is exactly the depth of information the\\ncustomer is looking for.\\n\\nFigure 620 shows the relationship among product vision, product roadmap, release planning, and iteration planning.\\n\\n216 \\n6.5.3 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.5.3.1 SCHEDULE BASELINE\\n\\nAschedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal change\\ncontrol procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriate\\nstakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline finish dates. During monitoring and\\ncontrolling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and finish dates to determine if variances haveccurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan.\\n\\n6.5.3.2 PROJECT SCHEDULE\\n\\nThe project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations,ilestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned finish date\\nfor each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resource\\nassignments have been confirmed and scheduled start and finish dates are established. This process usually occurs no\\nlater than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may also\\nbe developed with a defined target start and target finish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented in\\nsummary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Although\\na project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more of\\nthe following formats:\\n\\n Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listedn the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontal\\nbars placed according to start and finish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used.\\nDepending on the audience, float can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, the\\nbroader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent\\nwork packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 621\\nthat is presented in a WBSstructured format.\\n\\n217\\n Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion ofajor deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 621.\\n\\n Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams are commonly presented in the activityonnode\\ndiagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a pure\\nlogic diagram, as shown in Figure 611, or presented in a timescaled schedule network diagram format that\\nis sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 621. These diagrams, with\\nactivity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path schedule\\nactivities. This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities.\\nAnother presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a timescaled logic diagram. These diagrams\\ninclude a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They areptimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on the\\nsame line of the diagram in sequence.\\n\\nFigure 621 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reported\\nthrough asof date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 621 reflects schedule presentations in\\nthe forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailed\\nschedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 621 also visually shows the relationships among the\\ndifferent levels of detail of the project schedule.\\n\\n218 \\n219\\n6.5.3.3 SCHEDULE DATA\\n\\nThe schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information for describing and controlling the\\nschedule. The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes,\\nand documentation of all identified assumptions and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by application\\narea. Information frequently supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to:\\n\\n Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram;\\n\\n Alternative schedules, such as bestcase or worstcase, not resourceleveled or resourceleveled, or with or\\nwithout imposed dates; and\\n\\n Applied schedule reserves.\\n\\nSchedule data could also include such items as resource histograms, cashflow projections, order and delivery\\nschedules, or other relevant information.\\n\\n6.5.3.4 PROJECT CALENDARS\\n\\nA project calendar identifies working days and shifts that are available for scheduled activities. It distinguishes\\ntime periods in days or parts of days that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are not\\navailable for work. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods for\\nsome activities to calculate the project schedule. The project calendars may be updated.\\n\\n6.5.3.5 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Modifications to the project scope or project schedule may result in change requests\\nto the scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for\\nreview and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions may\\ninclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.\\n\\n220 \\n6.5.3.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change\\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may be updated to\\nreflect a change in the way the schedule was developed and will be managed.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to\\napproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a\\nrevised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.\\n\\n6.5.3.7 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes are updated to include any revised resource\\nrequirements and any other revisions generated by the Develop Schedule process.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log may be updated with changes to assumptions\\nin duration, resource utilization, sequencing, or other information that is revealed as a result of developing the\\nschedule model.\\n\\n Duration estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.1. The number and availability of resources, along with the\\nactivity dependencies can result in a change to the duration estimates. If the resourceleveling analysis changes\\nthe resource requirements, then the duration estimates will likely need to be updated as well.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with\\ntechniques that were efficient and effective in developing the schedule model.\\n\\n Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource leveling can have a significant effect on\\npreliminary estimates for the types and quantities of resources required. If the resourceleveling analysis changes\\nthe resource requirements, then the resource requirements are updated.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may need to be updated to reflect opportunities or\\nthreats perceived through scheduling assumptions.\\n\\n221\\n6.6 CONTROL SCHEDULE\\n\\nControl Schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managing\\nchanges to the schedule baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughout\\nthe project. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this\\nprocess are depicted in Figure 622. Figure 623 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n222 \\nUpdating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. Any change to the schedule baseline\\ncan only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Control Schedule, as a\\ncomponent of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, is concerned with:\\n\\n Determining the current status of the project schedule,\\n Influencing the factors that create schedule changes,\\n Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves,\\n\\n Determining if the project schedule has changed, and\\n\\n Managing the actual changes as they occur.\\n\\n223\\nWhen an agile approach is used, Control Schedule is concerned with:\\n\\n Determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered and\\naccepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle;\\n\\n Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting processes and improving,\\nif required;\\n\\n Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog);\\n\\n Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted (velocity) in the given time\\nper iteration (agreedupon work cycle duration, typically 2 weeks or 1 month);\\n\\n Determining that the project schedule has changed; and\\n Managing the actual changes as they occur.\\n\\nWhen work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means of\\nensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control. Scheduled status reviews and\\nwalkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete.\\n\\n6.6.1 CONTROL SCHEDULE: INPUTS\\n\\n6.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management describes the frequency\\nthat the schedule will be updated, how reserve will be used, and how the schedule will be controlled.\\n\\n Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline is compared with actual results to\\ndetermine if a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions\\ndocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly when monitoring and controlling the schedule\\nbaseline.\\n\\n Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis the\\nperformance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or\\npreventive action is necessary.\\n\\n224 \\n6.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to\\nlater phases in the project to improve schedule control.\\n\\n Project calendars. Described in Section 6.5.3.4. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar\\nto allow for different work periods for some activities to calculate the schedule forecasts.\\n\\n Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Project schedule refers to the most recent version with notations\\nto indicate updates, completed activities, and started activities as of the indicated date.\\n\\n Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars show the availability of team and\\nphysical resources.\\n\\n Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. Schedule data will be reviewed and updated in the Control\\nSchedule process.\\n\\n6.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which activities have\\nstarted, their progress (e.g., actual duration, remaining duration, and physical percent complete), and which activities\\nhave finished.\\n\\n6.6.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Control Schedule process include but are not limited to:\\n Existing formal and informal schedule controlrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines;\\n Schedule control tools; and\\n\\n Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.\\n\\n225\\n6.6.2 CONTROL SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.6.2.1 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule performance measurements such as schedule\\nvariance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original\\nschedule baseline.\\n\\n Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. It\\nis used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iteration\\nplanning (see Section 6.4.2.8). A forecast trend line can be used to predict the likely variance at iteration\\ncompletion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the ideal\\nburndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completion\\nbased on remaining work. Figure 624 is an example of an iteration burndown chart.\\n\\n226 \\n Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze schedule performance against\\nthe schedule baseline such as actual start and finish dates, percent complete, and remaining duration for work\\nin progress.\\n\\n Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine\\nwhether performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding\\nperformance to date and for comparing to future performance goals in the form of completion dates.\\n\\n Variance analysis. Variance analysis looks at variances in planned versus actual start and finish dates, planned\\nversus actual durations, and variances in float. Part of variance analysis is determining the cause and degree of\\nvariance relative to the schedule baseline (see Section 6.5.3.1), estimating the implications of those variances\\nfor future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. For example, aajor delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on the overall project schedule, while auch shorter delay on a critical or nearcritical activity may require immediate action.\\n\\n Whatif scenario analysis. Described in Section 6.5.2.4. Whatif scenario analysis is used to assess the various\\nscenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model into\\nalignment with the project management plan and approved baseline.\\n\\n6.6.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. The\\nvariance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date. Evaluating the progress of activities on\\nnear critical paths can identify schedule risk.\\n\\n6.6.2.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that provides\\nthe ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, to report variances to and progress made against the schedule\\nbaseline, and to forecast the effects of changes to the project schedule model.\\n\\n6.6.2.4 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.5.2.3. Resource optimization techniques involve the scheduling of activities and the resources\\nrequired by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.\\n\\n227\\n6.6.2.5 LEADS AND LAGS\\n\\nAdjusting leads and lags is applied during network analysis to find ways to bring project activities that are behind into\\nalignment with the plan. For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping can be adjusted to\\nstart before the exterior work of the building is completed by increasing the lead time in the relationship, or a technical\\nwriting team can adjust the start of editing the draft of a large document immediately after the document is written by\\neliminating or decreasing lag time.\\n\\n6.6.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREION\\n\\nSchedule compression techniques (see Section 6.5.2.6) are used to find ways to bring project activities that are\\nbehind into alignment with the plan by fast tracking or crashing the schedule for the remaining work.\\n\\n6.6.3 CONTROL SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.6.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work\\nis performing compared to the schedule baseline. Variances in the start and finish dates and the durations can be\\ncalculated at the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, the (SV) and\\n(SPI) are documented for inclusion in work performance reports (see Section 4.5.3.1).\\n\\n6.6.3.2 SCHEDULE FORECASTS\\n\\nSchedule updates are forecasts of estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the projects future based on\\ninformation and knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are updated and reissued based on work\\nperformance information provided as the project is executed. The information is based on the projects past performance\\nand expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions. This can include earned value performance\\nindicators, as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.\\n\\n228 \\n6.6.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Schedule variance analysis, as well as reviews of progress reports, results of performanceeasures, and modifications to the project scope or project schedule, may result in change requests to the schedule\\nbaseline, scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed\\nfor review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions may\\ninclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.\\n\\n6.6.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change\\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may be updated to\\nreflect a change in the way the schedule is managed.\\n\\n Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated in\\nresponse to approved change requests related to change in project scope, resources, or activity duration\\nestimates. The schedule baseline may be updated to reflect changes caused by schedule compression\\ntechniques or performance issues.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to\\napproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates.\\n\\n Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement\\nbaseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.\\nIn some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the\\nperformance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.\\n\\n229\\n6.6.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise\\nassumptions on activity sequencing, durations, and productivity.\\n\\n Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise the\\nway duration estimates were developed.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with\\ntechniques that were effective in maintaining the schedule, causes of variances, and corrective actions that were\\nused to respond to schedule variances.\\n\\n Project schedule. An updated project schedule (see Section 6.5.3.2) will be generated from the schedule model\\npopulated with updated schedule data to reflect the schedule changes and manage the project.\\n\\n Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars are updated to reflect changes to\\nthe utilization of resource calendars that were the result of optimizing resources, schedule compression, and\\ncorrective or preventive actions.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register and risk response plans within it, may be updated\\nbased on the risks that may arise due to schedule compression techniques.\\n\\n Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. New project schedule network diagrams may be developed to\\ndisplay approved remaining durations and approved modifications to the schedule. In some cases, project\\nschedule delays can be so severe that a new target schedule with forecasted start and finish dates is needed to\\nprovide realistic data for directing the work, measuring performance, and measuring progress.\\n\\n230 \\n'"

The project charter defines the summary milestone schedule that will influence theanagement of the project schedule.\\n\\n6.1.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan describes how the scope\\nwill be defined and developed, which will provide information on how the schedule will be developed.\\n\\n Development approach. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The product development approach will help define the\\nscheduling approach, estimating techniques, scheduling tools, and techniques for controlling the schedule.\\n\\n6.1.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Organizational culture and structure,\\n Team resource availability and skills and physical resource availability,\\n Scheduling software,\\n\\n Guidelines and criteria for tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes and procedures to satisfy the\\nspecific needs of the project, and\\n\\n Commercial databases, such as standardized estimating data.\\n\\n6.1.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Historical information and lessons learned repositories;\\n\\n Existing formal and informal schedule development, management and controlrelated policies, procedures,\\nand guidelines;\\n\\n Templates and forms; and\\n\\n Monitoring and reporting tools.\\n\\n180 \\n6.1.2 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in previous, similar projects:\\n\\n Schedule development, management, and control;\\n Scheduling methodologies (e.g., predictive or adaptive life cycle);\\n Scheduling software; and\\n\\n The specific industry for which the project is developed.\\n\\n6.1.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nA data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.\\nAlternatives analysis can include determining which schedule methodology to use, or how to combine variousethods on the project. It can also include determining how detailed the schedule needs to be, the duration of\\nwaves for rolling wave planning, and how often it should be reviewed and updated. An appropriate balance between\\nthe level of detail needed to manage the schedule and the amount of time it takes to keep it up to date needs to be\\nreached for each project.\\n\\n6.1.2.3 MEETINGS\\n\\nProject teams may hold planning meetings to develop the schedule management plan. Participants at these meetingsay include the project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone\\nwith responsibility for schedule planning or execution, and others as needed.\\n\\n6.1.3 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.1.3.1 SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nThe schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteria\\nand the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management plan may be\\nformal or informal, highly detailed, or broadly framed based on the needs of the project, and includes appropriate\\ncontrol thresholds.\\n\\n181\\nThe schedule management plan can establish the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProject schedule model development. The scheduling methodology and the scheduling tool to be used in the\\ndevelopment of the project schedule model are specified.\\n\\nRelease and iteration length. When using an adaptive life cycle, the timeboxed periods for releases, waves,\\nand iterations are specified. Timeboxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily toward\\ncompletion of a goal. Timeboxing helps to minimize scope creep as it forces the teams to process essential\\nfeatures first, then other features when time permits.\\n\\nLevel of accuracy. The level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining realistic activity\\nduration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies.\\n\\nUnits of measure. Each unit of measurement (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures, oreters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures) is defined for each of the resources.\\n\\nOrganizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the framework\\nfor the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates and resulting schedules.\\n\\nProject schedule model maintenance. The process used to update the status and record progress of the\\nproject in the schedule model during the execution of the project is defined.\\n\\nControl thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be specified to indicate an\\nagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically\\nexpressed as percentage deviations from the parameters established in the baseline plan.\\n\\nRules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules or other physical measurement\\nrules of performance measurement are set. For example, the schedule management plan may specify: Rules for establishing percent complete,\\n EVM techniques (e.g., baselines, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to be employed (for more specific\\ninformation, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value Management [17]), and\\n Schedule performance measurements such as schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI)\\nused to assess the magnitude of variation to the original schedule baseline.\\n\\nReporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined.\\n\\n182\\n\\n\\n6.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIES\\n\\nDefine Activities is the process of identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to produce\\nthe project deliverables. The key benefit of this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activities\\nthat provide a basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, monitoring, and controlling the project work. This process\\nis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in\\nFigure 65. Figure 66 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n183\\n6.2.1 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS\\n\\n6.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the\\nschedule methodology, the duration of waves for rolling wave planning, and the level of detail necessary toanage the work.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions\\ndocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while defining activities.\\n6.2.1.2 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\nEnterprise environmental factors that influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to:\\n Organizational cultures and structure,\\n\\n Published commercial information from commercial databases, and\\n\\n Project management information system (PMIS).\\n\\n6.2.1.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to:\\n Lessons learned repository containing historical information regarding activity lists used by previous similar projects,\\n Standardized processes,\\n Templates that contain a standard activity list or a portion of an activity list from a previous project, and\\n\\n Existing formal and informal activity planningrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the schedulingethodology, that are considered in developing the activity definitions.\\n\\n6.2.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledgef similar past projects and the work being performed.\\n\\n184 \\n6.2.2.2 DECOMPOSITION\\n\\nDescribed in Section 5.4.2.2. Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and\\nproject deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. Activities represent the effort needed to complete a work\\npackage. The Define Activities process defines the final outputs as activities rather than deliverables, as done in the\\nCreate WBS process (Section 5.4).\\n\\nThe activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently, with the WBS and WBS\\ndictionary used as the basis for development of the final activity list. Each work package within the WBS is decomposed\\ninto the activities required to produce the work package deliverables. Involving team members in the decomposition can\\nlead to better and more accurate results.\\n\\n6.2.2.3 ROLLING WAVE PLANNING\\n\\nRolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is\\nplanned in detail, while work further in the future is planned at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaboration\\napplicable to work packages, planning packages, and release planning when using an agile or waterfall approach.\\nTherefore, work can exist at various levels of detail depending on where it is in the project life cycle. During early\\nstrategic planning when information is less defined, work packages may be decomposed to the known level of detail. Asore is known about the upcoming events in the near term, work packages can be decomposed into activities.\\n\\n6.2.2.4 MEETINGS\\n\\nMeetings may be facetoface, virtual, formal, or informal. Meetings may be held with team members or subjectatter experts to define the activities needed to complete the work.\\n\\n6.2.3 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.2.3.1 ACTIVITY LIST\\n\\nThe activity list includes the schedule activities required on the project. For projects that use rolling wave planningr agile techniques, the activity list will be updated periodically as the project progresses. The activity list includes\\nan activity identifier and a scope of work description for each activity in sufficient detail to ensure that project teamembers understand what work is required to be completed.\\n\\n185\\n6.2.3.2 ACTIVITY ATTRIBUTES\\n\\nActivity attributes extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated with each\\nactivity. The components for each activity evolve over time. During the initial stages of the project, they include\\nthe unique activity identifier (ID), WBS ID, and activity label or name. When completed, they may include activity\\ndescriptions, predecessor activities, successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags (Section 6.3.2.3),\\nresource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify the\\nplace where the work has to be performed, the project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effort\\ninvolved. Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the planned\\nschedule activities in various ways within reports\\n\\n6.2.3.3 MILESTONE LIST\\n\\nA milestone is a significant point or event in a project. A milestone list identifies all project milestones and indicates\\nwhether the milestone is mandatory, such as those required by contract, or optional, such as those based on historical\\ninformation. Milestones have zero duration because they represent a significant point or event.\\n\\n6.2.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Once the project has been baselined, the progressive elaboration of deliverables into\\nactivities may reveal work that was not initially part of the project baselines. This may result in a change request.\\nChange requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process\\n(Section 4.6).\\n\\n6.2.3.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change\\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Throughout the project, work packages are progressively\\nelaborated into activities. This process may reveal work that was not part of the initial schedule baseline,\\nnecessitating a change to delivery dates or other significant schedule milestones that are part of the\\nschedule baseline.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to\\napproved changes in schedule activities.\\n\\n186 \\n6.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES\\n\\nSequence Activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities. The key\\nbenefit of this process is that it defines the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efficiency given all project\\nconstraints. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this\\nprocess are depicted in Figure 67. Figure 68 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n187\\nEvery activity except the first and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successor\\nactivity with an appropriate logical relationship. Logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic project\\nschedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable project\\nschedule. Sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automated\\ntechniques. The Sequence Activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram to\\nact as a first step to publish the schedule baseline.\\n\\n6.3.1 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS\\n\\n6.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the method\\nused and the level of accuracy along with other criteria required to sequence activities.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions\\ndocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while sequencing activities.\\n\\n6.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of\\nevents or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships\\nbetween the activities.\\n\\n Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the project\\nthat are to be sequenced. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence the sequencingf the activities.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may\\ninfluence the way activities are sequenced, the relationship between activities, and the need for leads and lags,\\nand may give rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.\\n\\n Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestones,\\nwhich may influence the way activities are sequenced.\\n\\n188 \\n6.3.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to:\\n Government or industry standards,\\n Project management information system (PMIS),\\n Scheduling tools, and\\n\\n Organization work authorization systems.\\n\\n6.3.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Portfolio and program plans and project dependencies and relationships;\\n\\n Existing formal and informal activity planningrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the schedulingethodology that is considered in developing logical relationships;\\n\\n Templates that can be used to expedite the preparation of networks for project activities. Related activity attributes\\ninformation in templates can also contain additional descriptive information useful in sequencing activities; and\\n\\n Lessons learned repository containing historical information that can help optimize the sequencing process.\\n\\n6.3.2 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.3.2.1 PRECEDENCE DIAGRAMMING METHOD\\n\\nThe precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities\\nare represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which\\nthe activities are to be performed.\\n\\nPDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that logically\\ncomes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after\\nanother activity in a schedule. These relationships are defined below and are illustrated in Figure 69:\\n\\n189\\n Finishtostart (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity\\nhas finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardware\\nis assembled (predecessor).\\n\\n Finishtofinish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity\\nhas finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to finish before editing the document\\n(successor) can finish.\\n\\n Starttostart (). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity\\nhas started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins.\\n\\n Starttofinish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity\\nhas started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) has to start before the old accounts\\npayable system can be shut down (predecessor).\\n\\nIn PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, but\\nis included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.\\n\\nTwo activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example,  and FF). Multiple relationships\\nbetween the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the\\nhighest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.\\n\\n190 \\n6.3.2.2 DEPENDENCY DETERMINATION AND INTEGRATION\\n\\nDependencies may be characterized by the following attributes: mandatory or discretionary, internal or external\\n(as described below). Dependency has four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the following\\nways: mandatory external dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, or\\ndiscretionary internal dependencies.\\n\\n Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required or\\ninherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations, such as on a\\nconstruction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built,r on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependencies\\nare sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory.\\nThe project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities.\\nMandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool.\\n\\n Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic,\\npreferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best\\npractices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequence\\nis desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted best\\npractices recommend that during construction, the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbing\\nwork. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performing\\nthe activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fully\\ndocumented since they can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling options. When fast\\ntracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered forodification or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the processf sequencing the activities.\\n\\n191\\n External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and non\\nproject activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control. For example, the\\ntesting activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, or\\ngovernmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction\\nproject. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of\\nsequencing the activities.\\n\\n Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and\\nare generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assemble\\nit, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependencies\\nare internal during the process of sequencing the activities.\\n\\n6.3.2.3 LEADS AND LAGS\\n\\nA lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,n a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduled\\npunch list completion. This would be shown as a finishtostart with a 2week lead as shown in Figure 610. Lead is often\\nrepresented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.\\n\\n192 \\nA lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,\\na technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can be\\nshown as a starttostart relationship with a 15day lag as shown in Figure 610. Lag can also be represented in project\\nschedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 611 in the relationship between activities H and / (as indicated by the\\nnomenclature +10 (starttostart plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale).\\n\\nThe project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately define the\\nlogical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Also, duration estimates do not include\\nany leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions should be documented.\\n\\n6.3.2.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems includes scheduling software that has the\\ncapability to help plan, organize, and adjust the sequence of the activities; insert the logical relationships, lead and lag\\nvalues; and differentiate the different types of dependencies.\\n\\n193\\n6.3.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.3.3.1 PROJECT SCHEDULE NETWORK DIAGRAMS\\n\\nA project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to as\\ndependencies, among the project schedule activities. Figure 611 illustrates a project schedule network diagram. A\\nproject schedule network diagram is produced manually or by using project management software. It can include full\\nproject details, or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describe\\nthe basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fully\\ndescribed within the narrative.\\n\\nActivities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have multiple successor\\nactivities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence are at greater risk as they are affected\\nby multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity | is called a path convergence, as it has more than one\\npredecessor, while activity K is called a path divergence, as it has more than one successor.\\n\\n6.3.3.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of\\nevents or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships\\nbetween the activities.\\n\\n Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list may be impacted by the change in relationships\\namong the project activities during the sequencing activities.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may\\nneed to be updated based on the sequencing, relationship determination, and leads and lags, and may give rise\\nto individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.\\n\\n Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The scheduled dates for specific milestones may be impacted by\\nchanges in relationships among the project activities during the sequencing activities.\\n\\n194 \\n6.4 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS\\n\\nEstimate Activity Durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual\\nactivities with estimated resources. The key benefit of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activity\\nwill take to complete. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of\\nthis process are depicted in Figure 612. Figure 613 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n195\\nEstimating activity durations uses information from the scope of work, required resource types or skill levels,\\nestimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may influence the duration estimates include\\nconstraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., fixed duration, fixed effort or work, fixed\\nnumber of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of durationriginate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the specific\\nactivity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of the\\ninput data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work,\\nthe accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.\\n\\n196 \\nThe Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete\\nthe activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity. These estimates are used to\\napproximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project\\nand resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an\\nactivity, along with the skill proficiency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a driving\\nresource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple “straightline” or\\nlinear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved,r number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation\\n(e.g., a 24hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include:\\n\\n Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce a\\nunit of work is increased while all other factors remain fixed, a point will eventually be reached at which additionsf that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output.\\n\\n Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does\\nnot always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point adding\\ntoo many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additional\\ncoordination, and other factors involved.\\n\\n Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, an\\nincrease in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology,\\nwhich may impact duration and resource needs.\\n\\n Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—or procrastination—\\nwhen people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Law\\nwhere work expands to fill the time available for its completion.\\n\\nAll data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate.\\n\\n197\\n6.4.1 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: INPUTS\\n\\n6.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the method\\nused, as well as the level of accuracy and other criteria required to estimate activity durations.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the WBS dictionary, which contains\\ntechnical details that can influence the effort and duration estimates.\\n\\n6.4.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\n\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe defined predecessor or\\nsuccessor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships between the activities that may\\nimpact duration estimates.\\n\\n Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the\\nproject, which are to be estimated. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence the\\nduration estimates.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may\\ngive rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to\\neffort and duration estimating can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precisionf effort and duration estimates.\\n\\n Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestones\\nthat may impact the duration estimates.\\n\\n Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project is staffed when the appropriate people\\nhave been assigned to the team.\\n\\n Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. The resource breakdown structure provides a\\nhierarchical structure of the identified resources by resource category and resource type.\\n\\n198 \\n Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars influence the duration of schedule\\nactivities due to the availability of specific resources, type of resources, and resources with specific attributes.\\nResource calendars specify when and how long identified project resources will be available during the project.\\n\\n Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The estimated activity resource requirements will have\\nan effect on the duration of the activity, since the level to which the resources assigned to the activity meet\\nthe requirements will significantly influence the duration of most activities. For example, if additional or lower\\nskilled resources are assigned to an activity, there may be reduced efficiency or productivity due to increased\\ncommunication, training, and coordination needs leading to a longer duration estimate.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Individual project risks may impact resource selection and\\navailability. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates, described in Section\\n11.5.3.2, from Plan Risk Responses.\\n\\n6.4.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Duration estimating databases and other reference data,\\n Productivity metrics,\\n Published commercial information, and\\n\\n Location of team members.\\n\\n6.4.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Historical duration information,\\n Project calendars,\\n\\n Estimating policies,\\n\\n Scheduling methodology, and\\n\\n Lessons learned repository.\\n\\n199\\n6.4.2 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics:\\n\\n Schedule development, management, and control;\\n Expertise in estimating; and\\n\\n Discipline or application knowledge.\\n\\n6.4.2.2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING\\n\\nAnalogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical\\ndata from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as\\nduration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future\\nproject. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basis\\nfor estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known\\ndifferences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when\\nthere is a limited amount of detailed information about the project.\\n\\nAnalogous estimating is generally less costly and less timeconsuming than other techniques, but it is also\\nless accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may\\nbe used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous\\nactivities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates\\nhave the needed expertise.\\n\\n6.4.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING\\n\\nParametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration basedn historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data\\nand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost,\\nbudget, and duration.\\n\\n200 \\nDurations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor\\nhours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by\\nthe number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor\\nhours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required to\\ninstall 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).\\n\\nThis technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into\\nthe model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction\\nwith other estimating methods.\\n\\n6.4.2.4 THREEPOINT ESTIMATING\\n\\nThe accuracy of singlepoint duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk.\\nUsing threepoint estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity’s duration:\\n\\n Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned,\\ntheir productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and\\ninterruptions.\\n\\n Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity.\\n Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.\\n\\nDepending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE,\\ncan be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:\\n\\ntE (tO + iM + tP)/ 3.\\n\\nTriangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental data. Duration\\nestimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range of\\nuncertainty around the expected duration.\\n\\n201\\n6.4.2.5 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATING\\n\\nBottomu\\n\\np estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower\\n\\nlevel components of the WBS. When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence,\\n\\nthe work wi\\n\\nhin the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates are\\n\\nthen aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependencies\\n\\nbetween the\\nusage is ref\\n that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resource\\nlected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity.\\n\\n6.4.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData ana\\n\\nlysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills;\\nscheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated);\\nand make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, and\\nduration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work.\\n\\n Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserve\\nneeded for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedule\\nreserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedule\\nbaseline, which is allocated for identified risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with the\\nknownunknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingency\\nreserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a fixed number of work periods. Contingency\\nreserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about the\\nproject becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be\\nclearly identified in the schedule documentation.\\n\\nEstimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Management\\nreserves are a specified amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are\\nreserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address\\nthe unknownunknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline,\\nbut it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of management\\nreserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.\\n\\n202 \\n6.4.2.7 DECISION MAKING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 5.2.2.4. Decisionmaking techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limited\\nto voting. One variation of the voting method that is often used in agilebased projects is called the fist of five (also called\\nfist to five). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding\\nup a closed fist (indicating no support) up to five fingers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer than\\nthree fingers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project manager\\ncontinues the fistoffive process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more fingers) or agrees\\nto move on to the next decision.\\n\\n6.4.2.8 MEETINGS\\n\\nThe project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessary\\nto conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decide\\nwhich of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to low\\nlevel tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacityver the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the first day of the iteration and is attended by the productwner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well as\\nassumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions.\\n\\n6.4.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.4.3.1 DURATION ESTIMATES\\n\\nDuration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to complete\\nan activity, a phase, or a project. Duration estimates do not include any lags as described in Section 6.3.2.3. Duration\\nestimates may include some indication of the range of possible results. For example:\\n\\n A range of 2 weeks + 2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and not more than 12\\n(assuming a 5day work week); or\\n\\n A 15% probability of exceeding 3 weeks, which indicates a high probability—85%—that the activity will take\\n3 weeks or less.\\n\\n203\\n6.4.3.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATES\\n\\nThe amount and type of additional details supporting the duration estimate vary by application area. Regardless of\\nthe level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the duration\\nestimate was derived.\\n\\nSupporting detail for duration estimates may include:\\n\\n Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed),\\n Documentation of all assumptions made,\\n\\n Documentation of any known constraints,\\n\\n Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., +10%) to indicate that the duration is estimated between a\\nrange of values),\\n\\n Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate, and\\n\\n Documentation of individual project risks influencing this estimate.\\n\\n6.4.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity duration estimates produced during this process are\\ndocumented as part of the activity attributes.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. This includes assumptions made in developing the duration\\nestimate, such as resource skill levels and availability, as well as a basis of estimates for durations. Additionally,\\nconstraints arising out of the scheduling methodology and scheduling tool are also documented.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with\\ntechniques that were efficient and effective in developing effort and duration estimates.\\n\\n204 \\n6.5 DEVELOP SCHEDULE\\n\\nDevelop Schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule\\nconstraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling. The key benefit of this\\nprocess is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities. This process\\nis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in\\nFigure 614. Figure 615 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n205\\n206 \\nDeveloping an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The schedule model is used to determine the\\nplanned start and finish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information. Schedule\\ndevelopment can require the review and revision of duration estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves to\\nestablish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress. Key steps include defining the\\nproject milestones, identifying and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and finish\\ndates have been determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assigned\\nactivities. The staff confirms that the start and finish dates present no conflict with resource calendars or assigned\\nactivities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed to determine conflicts with\\nlogical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined. Revising andaintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project,\\nas described in Section 6.7.\\n\\nFor more specific information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling.\\n\\n6.5.1 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: INPUTS\\n\\n6.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan identifies the\\nscheduling method and tool used to create the schedule and how the schedule is to be calculated.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary have details about\\nthe project deliverables that are considered when building the schedule model.\\n\\n6.5.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes.

Described in Section 6.4.3.2. The amount and type of additional details supporting the\\nduration estimate vary by application area. Regardless of the level of detail, the supporting documentation should\\nprovide a clear and complete understanding of how the duration estimate was derived.\\n\\n Duration estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.1. The duration estimates contain the quantitative assessmentsf the likely number of work periods that will be required to complete an activity. This will be used to calculate\\nthe schedule.\\n\\n Lessons learned. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to developing\\nthe schedule model can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the validity of the schedule model.\\n\\n Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list has scheduled dates for specific milestones.\\n\\n Project schedule network diagrams. Described in Section 6.3.3.1. The project schedule network diagrams\\ncontain the logical relationships of predecessors and successors that will be used to calculate the schedule.\\n\\n Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project team assignments specify which resources\\nare assigned to each activity.\\n\\n Resource calendars. Described in Sections 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars contain information on the\\navailability of resources during the project.\\n\\n Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The activity resource requirements identify the types and\\nquantities of resources required for each activity used to create the schedule model.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register provides the details of all identified risks, and their\\ncharacteristics, that affect the schedule model. Risk information relevant to the schedule is reflected in schedule\\nreserves using the expected or mean risk impact.\\n\\n6.5.1.3 AGREEMENTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 12.2.3.2. Vendors may have an input to the project schedule as they develop the details of how\\nthey will perform the project work to meet contractual commitments.\\n\\n208 \\n6.5.1.4 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Develop Schedule process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Government or industry standards, and\\n\\n Communication channels.\\n\\n6.5.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Develop Schedule process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Scheduling methodology containing the policies governing schedule model development and maintenance,\\nand\\n\\n Project calendar(s).\\n\\n6.5.2 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.5.2.1 SCHEDULE NETWORK ANALYSIS\\n\\nSchedule network analysis is the overarching technique used to generate the project schedule model. It employs\\nseveral other techniques such as critical path method (described in Section 6.5.2.2), resource optimization techniques\\n(described in Section 6.5.2.3), and modeling techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.4). Additional analysis includes but\\nis not limited to:\\n\\n Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiple\\npaths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time, to reduce the\\nprobability of a schedule slip.\\n\\n Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has highrisk activities or long lead items that would necessitate\\nuse of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path.\\n\\nSchedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed.\\n\\n209\\n6.5.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD\\n\\nThe critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule\\nflexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. This schedule network analysis technique calculates\\nthe early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations\\nby performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 616. In this\\nexample, the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and therefore the sequence of ACD is the critical path.\\nThe critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines\\nthe shortest possible project duration. The longest path has the least total float—usually zero. The resulting early\\nand late start and finish dates are not necessarily the project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods within\\nwhich the activity could be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logical\\nrelationships, leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path(s)\\nand the amount of total and free float or schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.\\n\\nOn any network path, the total float or schedule flexibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule\\nactivity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date or violating a\\nschedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total float on the critical path. As implemented\\nwith the precedence diagramming method sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total float\\ndepending on the constraints applied. Positive total float is caused when the backward pass is calculated from a\\nschedule constraint that is later than the early finish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation.\\nNegative total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative float\\nanalysis is a technique that helps to find possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track.\\nSchedule networks may have multiple nearcritical paths. Many software packages allow the user to define the\\nparameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments to activity durations (when more resources or less\\nscope can be arranged), logical relationships (when the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads and\\nlags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total float.\\nOnce the total float and the free float have been calculated, the free float is the amount of time that a schedule\\nactivity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. For\\nexample the free float for Activity B, in Figure 616, is 5 days.\\n\\n210 \\n6.5.2.3 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION\\n\\nResource optimization is used to adjust the start and finish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to be\\nequal to or less than resource availability. Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the\\nschedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Resource leveling. A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with\\nthe goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used when\\nshared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are over\\nallocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (as\\nshown in Figure 617), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can often\\ncause the original critical path to change. Available float is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the critical\\npath through the project schedule may change.\\n\\n Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for\\nresources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed to\\nresource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In other\\nwords, activities may only be delayed within their free and total float. Resource smoothing may not be able toptimize all resources.\\n\\n211\\n212 \\n6.5.2.4 DATA ANALYSIS\\nData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Whatif scenario analysis. Whatif scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict\\ntheir effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, “What if the situation\\nrepresented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to compute\\nthe different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending specific engineering durations,r introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the whatif\\nscenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and in\\npreparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations.\\n\\n Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty\\nto evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique is\\nMonte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate\\npossible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating multiple work package durations\\nwith different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributions\\nand other representations of uncertainty (see Section 11.4.2.4). Figure 618 shows a probability distribution for a\\nproject with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project finish date). In this example, there is a\\n10% probability that the project will finish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probabilityf completing the project by May 28.\\n\\n213\\nFor more information on how Monte Carlo simulation is used for schedule models, see the Practice Standard\\nfor Scheduling.\\n\\n6.5.2.5 LEADS AND LAGS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.3.2.3. Leads and lags are refinements applied during network analysis to develop a viable\\nschedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. Leads are used in limited circumstances to advance a\\nsuccessor activity with respect to the predecessor activity, and lags are used in limited circumstances where processes\\nrequire a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact.\\n\\n214 \\n6.5.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREION\\n\\nSchedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing the\\nproject scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful technique\\nis the negative float analysis. The critical path is the one with the least float. Due to violating a constraint or imposed\\ndate, the total float can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 619 and include:\\n\\n Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.\\nExamples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery\\nto activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources\\nwill shorten the activity’s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in\\nincreased risk and/or cost.\\n\\n Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence\\nare performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a\\nbuilding before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increased\\nrisk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical\\npath. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities\\nconcerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.\\n\\n215\\n6.5.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that expedites\\nthe process of building a schedule model by generating start and finish dates based on the inputs of activities, network\\ndiagrams, resources, and activity durations.\\n\\n6.5.2.8 AGILE RELEASE PLANNING\\n\\nAgile release planning provides a highlevel summary timeline of the release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months)\\nbased on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product’s evolution. Agile release planning also\\ndetermines the number of iterations or sprints in the release, and allows the product owner and team to decide\\nhow much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals,\\ndependencies, and impediments.\\n\\nSince features represent value to the customer, the timeline provides a more easily understood project schedule\\nas it defines which feature will be available at the end of each iteration, which is exactly the depth of information the\\ncustomer is looking for.\\n\\nFigure 620 shows the relationship among product vision, product roadmap, release planning, and iteration planning.\\n\\n216 \\n6.5.3 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.5.3.1 SCHEDULE BASELINE\\n\\nAschedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal change\\ncontrol procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriate\\nstakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline finish dates. During monitoring and\\ncontrolling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and finish dates to determine if variances haveccurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan.\\n\\n6.5.3.2 PROJECT SCHEDULE\\n\\nThe project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations,ilestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned finish date\\nfor each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resource\\nassignments have been confirmed and scheduled start and finish dates are established. This process usually occurs no\\nlater than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may also\\nbe developed with a defined target start and target finish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented in\\nsummary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Although\\na project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more of\\nthe following formats:\\n\\n Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listedn the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontal\\nbars placed according to start and finish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used.\\nDepending on the audience, float can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, the\\nbroader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent\\nwork packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 621\\nthat is presented in a WBSstructured format.\\n\\n217\\n Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion ofajor deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 621.\\n\\n Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams are commonly presented in the activityonnode\\ndiagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a pure\\nlogic diagram, as shown in Figure 611, or presented in a timescaled schedule network diagram format that\\nis sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 621. These diagrams, with\\nactivity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path schedule\\nactivities. This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities.\\nAnother presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a timescaled logic diagram. These diagrams\\ninclude a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They areptimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on the\\nsame line of the diagram in sequence.\\n\\nFigure 621 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reported\\nthrough asof date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 621 reflects schedule presentations in\\nthe forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailed\\nschedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 621 also visually shows the relationships among the\\ndifferent levels of detail of the project schedule.\\n\\n218 \\n219\\n6.5.3.3 SCHEDULE DATA\\n\\nThe schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information for describing and controlling the\\nschedule. The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes,\\nand documentation of all identified assumptions and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by application\\narea. Information frequently supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to:\\n\\n Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram;\\n\\n Alternative schedules, such as bestcase or worstcase, not resourceleveled or resourceleveled, or with or\\nwithout imposed dates; and\\n\\n Applied schedule reserves.\\n\\nSchedule data could also include such items as resource histograms, cashflow projections, order and delivery\\nschedules, or other relevant information.\\n\\n6.5.3.4 PROJECT CALENDARS\\n\\nA project calendar identifies working days and shifts that are available for scheduled activities. It distinguishes\\ntime periods in days or parts of days that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are not\\navailable for work. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods for\\nsome activities to calculate the project schedule. The project calendars may be updated.\\n\\n6.5.3.5 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Modifications to the project scope or project schedule may result in change requests\\nto the scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for\\nreview and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions may\\ninclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.\\n\\n220 \\n6.5.3.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change\\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may be updated to\\nreflect a change in the way the schedule was developed and will be managed.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to\\napproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a\\nrevised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.\\n\\n6.5.3.7 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes are updated to include any revised resource\\nrequirements and any other revisions generated by the Develop Schedule process.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log may be updated with changes to assumptions\\nin duration, resource utilization, sequencing, or other information that is revealed as a result of developing the\\nschedule model.\\n\\n Duration estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.1. The number and availability of resources, along with the\\nactivity dependencies can result in a change to the duration estimates. If the resourceleveling analysis changes\\nthe resource requirements, then the duration estimates will likely need to be updated as well.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with\\ntechniques that were efficient and effective in developing the schedule model.\\n\\n Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource leveling can have a significant effect on\\npreliminary estimates for the types and quantities of resources required. If the resourceleveling analysis changes\\nthe resource requirements, then the resource requirements are updated.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may need to be updated to reflect opportunities or\\nthreats perceived through scheduling assumptions.\\n\\n221\\n6.6 CONTROL SCHEDULE\\n\\nControl Schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managing\\nchanges to the schedule baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughout\\nthe project. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this\\nprocess are depicted in Figure 622. Figure 623 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n222 \\nUpdating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. Any change to the schedule baseline\\ncan only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Control Schedule, as a\\ncomponent of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, is concerned with:\\n\\n Determining the current status of the project schedule,\\n Influencing the factors that create schedule changes,\\n Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves,\\n\\n Determining if the project schedule has changed, and\\n\\n Managing the actual changes as they occur.\\n\\n223\\nWhen an agile approach is used, Control Schedule is concerned with:\\n\\n Determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered and\\naccepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle;\\n\\n Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting processes and improving,\\nif required;\\n\\n Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog);\\n\\n Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted (velocity) in the given time\\nper iteration (agreedupon work cycle duration, typically 2 weeks or 1 month);\\n\\n Determining that the project schedule has changed; and\\n Managing the actual changes as they occur.\\n\\nWhen work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means of\\nensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control. Scheduled status reviews and\\nwalkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete.\\n\\n6.6.1 CONTROL SCHEDULE: INPUTS\\n\\n6.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management describes the frequency\\nthat the schedule will be updated, how reserve will be used, and how the schedule will be controlled.\\n\\n Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline is compared with actual results to\\ndetermine if a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions\\ndocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly when monitoring and controlling the schedule\\nbaseline.\\n\\n Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis the\\nperformance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or\\npreventive action is necessary.\\n\\n224 \\n6.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to\\nlater phases in the project to improve schedule control.\\n\\n Project calendars. Described in Section 6.5.3.4. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar\\nto allow for different work periods for some activities to calculate the schedule forecasts.\\n\\n Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Project schedule refers to the most recent version with notations\\nto indicate updates, completed activities, and started activities as of the indicated date.\\n\\n Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars show the availability of team and\\nphysical resources.\\n\\n Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. Schedule data will be reviewed and updated in the Control\\nSchedule process.\\n\\n6.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which activities have\\nstarted, their progress (e.g., actual duration, remaining duration, and physical percent complete), and which activities\\nhave finished.\\n\\n6.6.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Control Schedule process include but are not limited to:\\n Existing formal and informal schedule controlrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines;\\n Schedule control tools; and\\n\\n Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.\\n\\n225\\n6.6.2 CONTROL SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.6.2.1 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule performance measurements such as schedule\\nvariance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original\\nschedule baseline.\\n\\n Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. It\\nis used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iteration\\nplanning (see Section 6.4.2.8). A forecast trend line can be used to predict the likely variance at iteration\\ncompletion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the ideal\\nburndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completion\\nbased on remaining work. Figure 624 is an example of an iteration burndown chart.\\n\\n226 \\n Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze schedule performance against\\nthe schedule baseline such as actual start and finish dates, percent complete, and remaining duration for work\\nin progress.\\n\\n Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine\\nwhether performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding\\nperformance to date and for comparing to future performance goals in the form of completion dates.\\n\\n Variance analysis. Variance analysis looks at variances in planned versus actual start and finish dates, planned\\nversus actual durations, and variances in float. Part of variance analysis is determining the cause and degree of\\nvariance relative to the schedule baseline (see Section 6.5.3.1), estimating the implications of those variances\\nfor future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. For example, aajor delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on the overall project schedule, while auch shorter delay on a critical or nearcritical activity may require immediate action.\\n\\n Whatif scenario analysis. Described in Section 6.5.2.4. Whatif scenario analysis is used to assess the various\\nscenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model into\\nalignment with the project management plan and approved baseline.\\n\\n6.6.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. The\\nvariance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date. Evaluating the progress of activities on\\nnear critical paths can identify schedule risk.\\n\\n6.6.2.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that provides\\nthe ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, to report variances to and progress made against the schedule\\nbaseline, and to forecast the effects of changes to the project schedule model.\\n\\n6.6.2.4 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.5.2.3. Resource optimization techniques involve the scheduling of activities and the resources\\nrequired by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.\\n\\n227\\n6.6.2.5 LEADS AND LAGS\\n\\nAdjusting leads and lags is applied during network analysis to find ways to bring project activities that are behind into\\nalignment with the plan. For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping can be adjusted to\\nstart before the exterior work of the building is completed by increasing the lead time in the relationship, or a technical\\nwriting team can adjust the start of editing the draft of a large document immediately after the document is written by\\neliminating or decreasing lag time.\\n\\n6.6.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREION\\n\\nSchedule compression techniques (see Section 6.5.2.6) are used to find ways to bring project activities that are\\nbehind into alignment with the plan by fast tracking or crashing the schedule for the remaining work.\\n\\n6.6.3 CONTROL SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.6.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work\\nis performing compared to the schedule baseline. Variances in the start and finish dates and the durations can be\\ncalculated at the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, the (SV) and\\n(SPI) are documented for inclusion in work performance reports (see Section 4.5.3.1).\\n\\n6.6.3.2 SCHEDULE FORECASTS\\n\\nSchedule updates are forecasts of estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the projects future based on\\ninformation and knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are updated and reissued based on work\\nperformance information provided as the project is executed. The information is based on the projects past performance\\nand expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions. This can include earned value performance\\nindicators, as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.\\n\\n228 \\n6.6.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Schedule variance analysis, as well as reviews of progress reports, results of performanceeasures, and modifications to the project scope or project schedule, may result in change requests to the schedule\\nbaseline, scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed\\nfor review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions may\\ninclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.\\n\\n6.6.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change\\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may be updated to\\nreflect a change in the way the schedule is managed.\\n\\n Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated in\\nresponse to approved change requests related to change in project scope, resources, or activity duration\\nestimates. The schedule baseline may be updated to reflect changes caused by schedule compression\\ntechniques or performance issues.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to\\napproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates.\\n\\n Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement\\nbaseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.\\nIn some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the\\nperformance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.\\n\\n229\\n6.6.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise\\nassumptions on activity sequencing, durations, and productivity.\\n\\n Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise the\\nway duration estimates were developed.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with\\ntechniques that were effective in maintaining the schedule, causes of variances, and corrective actions that were\\nused to respond to schedule variances.\\n\\n Project schedule. An updated project schedule (see Section 6.5.3.2) will be generated from the schedule model\\npopulated with updated schedule data to reflect the schedule changes and manage the project.\\n\\n Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars are updated to reflect changes to\\nthe utilization of resource calendars that were the result of optimizing resources, schedule compression, and\\ncorrective or preventive actions.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register and risk response plans within it, may be updated\\nbased on the risks that may arise due to schedule compression techniques.\\n\\n Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. New project schedule network diagrams may be developed to\\ndisplay approved remaining durations and approved modifications to the schedule. In some cases, project\\nschedule delays can be so severe that a new target schedule with forecasted start and finish dates is needed to\\nprovide realistic data for directing the work, measuring performance, and measuring progress.\\n\\n230 \\n']\n"

The project charter defines the summary milestone schedule that will influence theanagement of the project schedule.\\n\\n6.1.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan describes how the scope\\nwill be defined and developed, which will provide information on how the schedule will be developed.\\n\\n Development approach. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The product development approach will help define the\\nscheduling approach, estimating techniques, scheduling tools, and techniques for controlling the schedule.\\n\\n6.1.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Organizational culture and structure,\\n Team resource availability and skills and physical resource availability,\\n Scheduling software,\\n\\n Guidelines and criteria for tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes and procedures to satisfy the\\nspecific needs of the project, and\\n\\n Commercial databases, such as standardized estimating data.\\n\\n6.1.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Historical information and lessons learned repositories;\\n\\n Existing formal and informal schedule development, management and controlrelated policies, procedures,\\nand guidelines;\\n\\n Templates and forms; and\\n\\n Monitoring and reporting tools.\\n\\n180 \\n6.1.2 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in previous, similar projects:\\n\\n Schedule development, management, and control;\\n Scheduling methodologies (e.g., predictive or adaptive life cycle);\\n Scheduling software; and\\n\\n The specific industry for which the project is developed.\\n\\n6.1.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nA data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.\\nAlternatives analysis can include determining which schedule methodology to use, or how to combine variousethods on the project. It can also include determining how detailed the schedule needs to be, the duration of\\nwaves for rolling wave planning, and how often it should be reviewed and updated. An appropriate balance between\\nthe level of detail needed to manage the schedule and the amount of time it takes to keep it up to date needs to be\\nreached for each project.\\n\\n6.1.2.3 MEETINGS\\n\\nProject teams may hold planning meetings to develop the schedule management plan. Participants at these meetingsay include the project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone\\nwith responsibility for schedule planning or execution, and others as needed.\\n\\n6.1.3 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.1.3.1 SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nThe schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteria\\nand the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management plan may be\\nformal or informal, highly detailed, or broadly framed based on the needs of the project, and includes appropriate\\ncontrol thresholds.\\n\\n181\\nThe schedule management plan can establish the following:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProject schedule model development. The scheduling methodology and the scheduling tool to be used in the\\ndevelopment of the project schedule model are specified.\\n\\nRelease and iteration length. When using an adaptive life cycle, the timeboxed periods for releases, waves,\\nand iterations are specified. Timeboxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily toward\\ncompletion of a goal. Timeboxing helps to minimize scope creep as it forces the teams to process essential\\nfeatures first, then other features when time permits.\\n\\nLevel of accuracy. The level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining realistic activity\\nduration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies.\\n\\nUnits of measure. Each unit of measurement (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures, oreters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures) is defined for each of the resources.\\n\\nOrganizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the framework\\nfor the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates and resulting schedules.\\n\\nProject schedule model maintenance. The process used to update the status and record progress of the\\nproject in the schedule model during the execution of the project is defined.\\n\\nControl thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be specified to indicate an\\nagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically\\nexpressed as percentage deviations from the parameters established in the baseline plan.\\n\\nRules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules or other physical measurement\\nrules of performance measurement are set. For example, the schedule management plan may specify: Rules for establishing percent complete,\\n EVM techniques (e.g., baselines, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to be employed (for more specific\\ninformation, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value Management [17]), and\\n Schedule performance measurements such as schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI)\\nused to assess the magnitude of variation to the original schedule baseline.\\n\\nReporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined.\\n\\n182\\n\\n\\n6.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIES\\n\\nDefine Activities is the process of identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to produce\\nthe project deliverables. The key benefit of this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activities\\nthat provide a basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, monitoring, and controlling the project work. This process\\nis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in\\nFigure 65. Figure 66 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n183\\n6.2.1 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS\\n\\n6.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the\\nschedule methodology, the duration of waves for rolling wave planning, and the level of detail necessary toanage the work.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions\\ndocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while defining activities.\\n6.2.1.2 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\nEnterprise environmental factors that influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to:\\n Organizational cultures and structure,\\n\\n Published commercial information from commercial databases, and\\n\\n Project management information system (PMIS).\\n\\n6.2.1.3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to:\\n Lessons learned repository containing historical information regarding activity lists used by previous similar projects,\\n Standardized processes,\\n Templates that contain a standard activity list or a portion of an activity list from a previous project, and\\n\\n Existing formal and informal activity planningrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the schedulingethodology, that are considered in developing the activity definitions.\\n\\n6.2.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledgef similar past projects and the work being performed.\\n\\n184 \\n6.2.2.2 DECOMPOSITION\\n\\nDescribed in Section 5.4.2.2. Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and\\nproject deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. Activities represent the effort needed to complete a work\\npackage. The Define Activities process defines the final outputs as activities rather than deliverables, as done in the\\nCreate WBS process (Section 5.4).\\n\\nThe activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently, with the WBS and WBS\\ndictionary used as the basis for development of the final activity list. Each work package within the WBS is decomposed\\ninto the activities required to produce the work package deliverables. Involving team members in the decomposition can\\nlead to better and more accurate results.\\n\\n6.2.2.3 ROLLING WAVE PLANNING\\n\\nRolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is\\nplanned in detail, while work further in the future is planned at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaboration\\napplicable to work packages, planning packages, and release planning when using an agile or waterfall approach.\\nTherefore, work can exist at various levels of detail depending on where it is in the project life cycle. During early\\nstrategic planning when information is less defined, work packages may be decomposed to the known level of detail. Asore is known about the upcoming events in the near term, work packages can be decomposed into activities.\\n\\n6.2.2.4 MEETINGS\\n\\nMeetings may be facetoface, virtual, formal, or informal. Meetings may be held with team members or subjectatter experts to define the activities needed to complete the work.\\n\\n6.2.3 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.2.3.1 ACTIVITY LIST\\n\\nThe activity list includes the schedule activities required on the project. For projects that use rolling wave planningr agile techniques, the activity list will be updated periodically as the project progresses. The activity list includes\\nan activity identifier and a scope of work description for each activity in sufficient detail to ensure that project teamembers understand what work is required to be completed.\\n\\n185\\n6.2.3.2 ACTIVITY ATTRIBUTES\\n\\nActivity attributes extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated with each\\nactivity. The components for each activity evolve over time. During the initial stages of the project, they include\\nthe unique activity identifier (ID), WBS ID, and activity label or name. When completed, they may include activity\\ndescriptions, predecessor activities, successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags (Section 6.3.2.3),\\nresource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify the\\nplace where the work has to be performed, the project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effort\\ninvolved. Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the planned\\nschedule activities in various ways within reports\\n\\n6.2.3.3 MILESTONE LIST\\n\\nA milestone is a significant point or event in a project. A milestone list identifies all project milestones and indicates\\nwhether the milestone is mandatory, such as those required by contract, or optional, such as those based on historical\\ninformation. Milestones have zero duration because they represent a significant point or event.\\n\\n6.2.3.4 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Once the project has been baselined, the progressive elaboration of deliverables into\\nactivities may reveal work that was not initially part of the project baselines. This may result in a change request.\\nChange requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process\\n(Section 4.6).\\n\\n6.2.3.5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change\\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Throughout the project, work packages are progressively\\nelaborated into activities. This process may reveal work that was not part of the initial schedule baseline,\\nnecessitating a change to delivery dates or other significant schedule milestones that are part of the\\nschedule baseline.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to\\napproved changes in schedule activities.\\n\\n186 \\n6.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES\\n\\nSequence Activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities. The key\\nbenefit of this process is that it defines the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efficiency given all project\\nconstraints. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this\\nprocess are depicted in Figure 67. Figure 68 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n187\\nEvery activity except the first and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successor\\nactivity with an appropriate logical relationship. Logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic project\\nschedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable project\\nschedule. Sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automated\\ntechniques. The Sequence Activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram to\\nact as a first step to publish the schedule baseline.\\n\\n6.3.1 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS\\n\\n6.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the method\\nused and the level of accuracy along with other criteria required to sequence activities.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions\\ndocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while sequencing activities.\\n\\n6.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of\\nevents or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships\\nbetween the activities.\\n\\n Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the project\\nthat are to be sequenced. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence the sequencingf the activities.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may\\ninfluence the way activities are sequenced, the relationship between activities, and the need for leads and lags,\\nand may give rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.\\n\\n Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestones,\\nwhich may influence the way activities are sequenced.\\n\\n188 \\n6.3.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to:\\n Government or industry standards,\\n Project management information system (PMIS),\\n Scheduling tools, and\\n\\n Organization work authorization systems.\\n\\n6.3.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Portfolio and program plans and project dependencies and relationships;\\n\\n Existing formal and informal activity planningrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the schedulingethodology that is considered in developing logical relationships;\\n\\n Templates that can be used to expedite the preparation of networks for project activities. Related activity attributes\\ninformation in templates can also contain additional descriptive information useful in sequencing activities; and\\n\\n Lessons learned repository containing historical information that can help optimize the sequencing process.\\n\\n6.3.2 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.3.2.1 PRECEDENCE DIAGRAMMING METHOD\\n\\nThe precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities\\nare represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in which\\nthe activities are to be performed.\\n\\nPDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that logically\\ncomes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes after\\nanother activity in a schedule. These relationships are defined below and are illustrated in Figure 69:\\n\\n189\\n Finishtostart (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity\\nhas finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardware\\nis assembled (predecessor).\\n\\n Finishtofinish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity\\nhas finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to finish before editing the document\\n(successor) can finish.\\n\\n Starttostart (). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity\\nhas started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins.\\n\\n Starttofinish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity\\nhas started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) has to start before the old accounts\\npayable system can be shut down (predecessor).\\n\\nIn PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, but\\nis included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.\\n\\nTwo activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example,  and FF). Multiple relationships\\nbetween the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with the\\nhighest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.\\n\\n190 \\n6.3.2.2 DEPENDENCY DETERMINATION AND INTEGRATION\\n\\nDependencies may be characterized by the following attributes: mandatory or discretionary, internal or external\\n(as described below). Dependency has four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the following\\nways: mandatory external dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, or\\ndiscretionary internal dependencies.\\n\\n Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required or\\ninherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations, such as on a\\nconstruction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built,r on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependencies\\nare sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory.\\nThe project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities.\\nMandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool.\\n\\n Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic,\\npreferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of best\\npractices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequence\\nis desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted best\\npractices recommend that during construction, the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbing\\nwork. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performing\\nthe activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fully\\ndocumented since they can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling options. When fast\\ntracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered forodification or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the processf sequencing the activities.\\n\\n191\\n External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and non\\nproject activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control. For example, the\\ntesting activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, or\\ngovernmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a construction\\nproject. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process of\\nsequencing the activities.\\n\\n Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities and\\nare generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assemble\\nit, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependencies\\nare internal during the process of sequencing the activities.\\n\\n6.3.2.3 LEADS AND LAGS\\n\\nA lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,n a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduled\\npunch list completion. This would be shown as a finishtostart with a 2week lead as shown in Figure 610. Lead is often\\nrepresented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.\\n\\n192 \\nA lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,\\na technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can be\\nshown as a starttostart relationship with a 15day lag as shown in Figure 610. Lag can also be represented in project\\nschedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 611 in the relationship between activities H and / (as indicated by the\\nnomenclature +10 (starttostart plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale).\\n\\nThe project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately define the\\nlogical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Also, duration estimates do not include\\nany leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions should be documented.\\n\\n6.3.2.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems includes scheduling software that has the\\ncapability to help plan, organize, and adjust the sequence of the activities; insert the logical relationships, lead and lag\\nvalues; and differentiate the different types of dependencies.\\n\\n193\\n6.3.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.3.3.1 PROJECT SCHEDULE NETWORK DIAGRAMS\\n\\nA project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to as\\ndependencies, among the project schedule activities. Figure 611 illustrates a project schedule network diagram. A\\nproject schedule network diagram is produced manually or by using project management software. It can include full\\nproject details, or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describe\\nthe basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fully\\ndescribed within the narrative.\\n\\nActivities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have multiple successor\\nactivities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence are at greater risk as they are affected\\nby multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity | is called a path convergence, as it has more than one\\npredecessor, while activity K is called a path divergence, as it has more than one successor.\\n\\n6.3.3.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence of\\nevents or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships\\nbetween the activities.\\n\\n Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list may be impacted by the change in relationships\\namong the project activities during the sequencing activities.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may\\nneed to be updated based on the sequencing, relationship determination, and leads and lags, and may give rise\\nto individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.\\n\\n Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The scheduled dates for specific milestones may be impacted by\\nchanges in relationships among the project activities during the sequencing activities.\\n\\n194 \\n6.4 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS\\n\\nEstimate Activity Durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individual\\nactivities with estimated resources. The key benefit of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activity\\nwill take to complete. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of\\nthis process are depicted in Figure 612. Figure 613 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n195\\nEstimating activity durations uses information from the scope of work, required resource types or skill levels,\\nestimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may influence the duration estimates include\\nconstraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., fixed duration, fixed effort or work, fixed\\nnumber of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of durationriginate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the specific\\nactivity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of the\\ninput data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work,\\nthe accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.\\n\\n196 \\nThe Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to complete\\nthe activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity. These estimates are used to\\napproximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate project\\nand resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish an\\nactivity, along with the skill proficiency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a driving\\nresource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple “straightline” or\\nlinear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved,r number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation\\n(e.g., a 24hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include:\\n\\n Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce a\\nunit of work is increased while all other factors remain fixed, a point will eventually be reached at which additionsf that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output.\\n\\n Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources does\\nnot always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point adding\\ntoo many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additional\\ncoordination, and other factors involved.\\n\\n Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, an\\nincrease in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology,\\nwhich may impact duration and resource needs.\\n\\n Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—or procrastination—\\nwhen people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Law\\nwhere work expands to fill the time available for its completion.\\n\\nAll data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate.\\n\\n197\\n6.4.1 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: INPUTS\\n\\n6.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan defines the method\\nused, as well as the level of accuracy and other criteria required to estimate activity durations.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the WBS dictionary, which contains\\ntechnical details that can influence the effort and duration estimates.\\n\\n6.4.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\n\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes may describe defined predecessor or\\nsuccessor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships between the activities that may\\nimpact duration estimates.\\n\\n Activity list. Described in Section 6.2.3.1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the\\nproject, which are to be estimated. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence the\\nduration estimates.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log may\\ngive rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to\\neffort and duration estimating can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precisionf effort and duration estimates.\\n\\n Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestones\\nthat may impact the duration estimates.\\n\\n Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project is staffed when the appropriate people\\nhave been assigned to the team.\\n\\n Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. The resource breakdown structure provides a\\nhierarchical structure of the identified resources by resource category and resource type.\\n\\n198 \\n Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars influence the duration of schedule\\nactivities due to the availability of specific resources, type of resources, and resources with specific attributes.\\nResource calendars specify when and how long identified project resources will be available during the project.\\n\\n Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The estimated activity resource requirements will have\\nan effect on the duration of the activity, since the level to which the resources assigned to the activity meet\\nthe requirements will significantly influence the duration of most activities. For example, if additional or lower\\nskilled resources are assigned to an activity, there may be reduced efficiency or productivity due to increased\\ncommunication, training, and coordination needs leading to a longer duration estimate.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Individual project risks may impact resource selection and\\navailability. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates, described in Section\\n11.5.3.2, from Plan Risk Responses.\\n\\n6.4.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Duration estimating databases and other reference data,\\n Productivity metrics,\\n Published commercial information, and\\n\\n Location of team members.\\n\\n6.4.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Historical duration information,\\n Project calendars,\\n\\n Estimating policies,\\n\\n Scheduling methodology, and\\n\\n Lessons learned repository.\\n\\n199\\n6.4.2 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics:\\n\\n Schedule development, management, and control;\\n Expertise in estimating; and\\n\\n Discipline or application knowledge.\\n\\n6.4.2.2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING\\n\\nAnalogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historical\\ndata from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such as\\nduration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a future\\nproject. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basis\\nfor estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for known\\ndifferences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration when\\nthere is a limited amount of detailed information about the project.\\n\\nAnalogous estimating is generally less costly and less timeconsuming than other techniques, but it is also\\nless accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and may\\nbe used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previous\\nactivities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimates\\nhave the needed expertise.\\n\\n6.4.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING\\n\\nParametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration basedn historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical data\\nand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost,\\nbudget, and duration.\\n\\n200 \\nDurations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of labor\\nhours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied by\\nthe number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of labor\\nhours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required to\\ninstall 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).\\n\\nThis technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into\\nthe model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction\\nwith other estimating methods.\\n\\n6.4.2.4 THREEPOINT ESTIMATING\\n\\nThe accuracy of singlepoint duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk.\\nUsing threepoint estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity’s duration:\\n\\n Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned,\\ntheir productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, and\\ninterruptions.\\n\\n Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity.\\n Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.\\n\\nDepending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE,\\ncan be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:\\n\\ntE (tO + iM + tP)/ 3.\\n\\nTriangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental data. Duration\\nestimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range of\\nuncertainty around the expected duration.\\n\\n201\\n6.4.2.5 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATING\\n\\nBottomu\\n\\np estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower\\n\\nlevel components of the WBS. When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence,\\n\\nthe work wi\\n\\nhin the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates are\\n\\nthen aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependencies\\n\\nbetween the\\nusage is ref\\n that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resource\\nlected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity.\\n\\n6.4.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData ana\\n\\nlysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills;\\nscheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated);\\nand make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, and\\nduration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work.\\n\\n Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserve\\nneeded for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedule\\nreserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedule\\nbaseline, which is allocated for identified risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with the\\nknownunknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingency\\nreserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a fixed number of work periods. Contingency\\nreserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about the\\nproject becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should be\\nclearly identified in the schedule documentation.\\n\\nEstimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Management\\nreserves are a specified amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and are\\nreserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address\\nthe unknownunknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline,\\nbut it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of management\\nreserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.\\n\\n202 \\n6.4.2.7 DECISION MAKING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 5.2.2.4. Decisionmaking techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limited\\nto voting. One variation of the voting method that is often used in agilebased projects is called the fist of five (also called\\nfist to five). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding\\nup a closed fist (indicating no support) up to five fingers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer than\\nthree fingers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project manager\\ncontinues the fistoffive process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more fingers) or agrees\\nto move on to the next decision.\\n\\n6.4.2.8 MEETINGS\\n\\nThe project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessary\\nto conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decide\\nwhich of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to low\\nlevel tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacityver the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the first day of the iteration and is attended by the productwner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well as\\nassumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions.\\n\\n6.4.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.4.3.1 DURATION ESTIMATES\\n\\nDuration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to complete\\nan activity, a phase, or a project. Duration estimates do not include any lags as described in Section 6.3.2.3. Duration\\nestimates may include some indication of the range of possible results. For example:\\n\\n A range of 2 weeks + 2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and not more than 12\\n(assuming a 5day work week); or\\n\\n A 15% probability of exceeding 3 weeks, which indicates a high probability—85%—that the activity will take\\n3 weeks or less.\\n\\n203\\n6.4.3.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATES\\n\\nThe amount and type of additional details supporting the duration estimate vary by application area. Regardless of\\nthe level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the duration\\nestimate was derived.\\n\\nSupporting detail for duration estimates may include:\\n\\n Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed),\\n Documentation of all assumptions made,\\n\\n Documentation of any known constraints,\\n\\n Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., +10%) to indicate that the duration is estimated between a\\nrange of values),\\n\\n Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate, and\\n\\n Documentation of individual project risks influencing this estimate.\\n\\n6.4.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity duration estimates produced during this process are\\ndocumented as part of the activity attributes.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. This includes assumptions made in developing the duration\\nestimate, such as resource skill levels and availability, as well as a basis of estimates for durations. Additionally,\\nconstraints arising out of the scheduling methodology and scheduling tool are also documented.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with\\ntechniques that were efficient and effective in developing effort and duration estimates.\\n\\n204 \\n6.5 DEVELOP SCHEDULE\\n\\nDevelop Schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule\\nconstraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling. The key benefit of this\\nprocess is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities. This process\\nis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in\\nFigure 614. Figure 615 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n205\\n206 \\nDeveloping an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The schedule model is used to determine the\\nplanned start and finish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information. Schedule\\ndevelopment can require the review and revision of duration estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves to\\nestablish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress. Key steps include defining the\\nproject milestones, identifying and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and finish\\ndates have been determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assigned\\nactivities. The staff confirms that the start and finish dates present no conflict with resource calendars or assigned\\nactivities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed to determine conflicts with\\nlogical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined. Revising andaintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project,\\nas described in Section 6.7.\\n\\nFor more specific information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling.\\n\\n6.5.1 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: INPUTS\\n\\n6.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1.

Described in Section 6.4.3.1. The duration estimates contain the quantitative assessmentsf the likely number of work periods that will be required to complete an activity. This will be used to calculate\\nthe schedule.\\n\\n Lessons learned. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to developing\\nthe schedule model can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the validity of the schedule model.\\n\\n Milestone list. Described in Section 6.2.3.3. The milestone list has scheduled dates for specific milestones.\\n\\n Project schedule network diagrams. Described in Section 6.3.3.1. The project schedule network diagrams\\ncontain the logical relationships of predecessors and successors that will be used to calculate the schedule.\\n\\n Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project team assignments specify which resources\\nare assigned to each activity.\\n\\n Resource calendars. Described in Sections 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars contain information on the\\navailability of resources during the project.\\n\\n Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The activity resource requirements identify the types and\\nquantities of resources required for each activity used to create the schedule model.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register provides the details of all identified risks, and their\\ncharacteristics, that affect the schedule model. Risk information relevant to the schedule is reflected in schedule\\nreserves using the expected or mean risk impact.\\n\\n6.5.1.3 AGREEMENTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 12.2.3.2. Vendors may have an input to the project schedule as they develop the details of how\\nthey will perform the project work to meet contractual commitments.\\n\\n208 \\n6.5.1.4 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Develop Schedule process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Government or industry standards, and\\n\\n Communication channels.\\n\\n6.5.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Develop Schedule process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Scheduling methodology containing the policies governing schedule model development and maintenance,\\nand\\n\\n Project calendar(s).\\n\\n6.5.2 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.5.2.1 SCHEDULE NETWORK ANALYSIS\\n\\nSchedule network analysis is the overarching technique used to generate the project schedule model. It employs\\nseveral other techniques such as critical path method (described in Section 6.5.2.2), resource optimization techniques\\n(described in Section 6.5.2.3), and modeling techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.4). Additional analysis includes but\\nis not limited to:\\n\\n Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiple\\npaths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time, to reduce the\\nprobability of a schedule slip.\\n\\n Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has highrisk activities or long lead items that would necessitate\\nuse of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path.\\n\\nSchedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed.\\n\\n209\\n6.5.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD\\n\\nThe critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule\\nflexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. This schedule network analysis technique calculates\\nthe early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitations\\nby performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 616. In this\\nexample, the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and therefore the sequence of ACD is the critical path.\\nThe critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines\\nthe shortest possible project duration. The longest path has the least total float—usually zero. The resulting early\\nand late start and finish dates are not necessarily the project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods within\\nwhich the activity could be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logical\\nrelationships, leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path(s)\\nand the amount of total and free float or schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.\\n\\nOn any network path, the total float or schedule flexibility is measured by the amount of time that a schedule\\nactivity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date or violating a\\nschedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total float on the critical path. As implemented\\nwith the precedence diagramming method sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total float\\ndepending on the constraints applied. Positive total float is caused when the backward pass is calculated from a\\nschedule constraint that is later than the early finish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation.\\nNegative total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative float\\nanalysis is a technique that helps to find possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track.\\nSchedule networks may have multiple nearcritical paths. Many software packages allow the user to define the\\nparameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments to activity durations (when more resources or less\\nscope can be arranged), logical relationships (when the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads and\\nlags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total float.\\nOnce the total float and the free float have been calculated, the free float is the amount of time that a schedule\\nactivity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. For\\nexample the free float for Activity B, in Figure 616, is 5 days.\\n\\n210 \\n6.5.2.3 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION\\n\\nResource optimization is used to adjust the start and finish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to be\\nequal to or less than resource availability. Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust the\\nschedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Resource leveling. A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints with\\nthe goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used when\\nshared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are over\\nallocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (as\\nshown in Figure 617), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can often\\ncause the original critical path to change. Available float is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the critical\\npath through the project schedule may change.\\n\\n Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for\\nresources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed to\\nresource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In other\\nwords, activities may only be delayed within their free and total float. Resource smoothing may not be able toptimize all resources.\\n\\n211\\n212 \\n6.5.2.4 DATA ANALYSIS\\nData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Whatif scenario analysis. Whatif scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predict\\ntheir effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, “What if the situation\\nrepresented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to compute\\nthe different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending specific engineering durations,r introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the whatif\\nscenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and in\\npreparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations.\\n\\n Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty\\nto evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique is\\nMonte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculate\\npossible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating multiple work package durations\\nwith different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributions\\nand other representations of uncertainty (see Section 11.4.2.4). Figure 618 shows a probability distribution for a\\nproject with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project finish date). In this example, there is a\\n10% probability that the project will finish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probabilityf completing the project by May 28.\\n\\n213\\nFor more information on how Monte Carlo simulation is used for schedule models, see the Practice Standard\\nfor Scheduling.\\n\\n6.5.2.5 LEADS AND LAGS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.3.2.3. Leads and lags are refinements applied during network analysis to develop a viable\\nschedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. Leads are used in limited circumstances to advance a\\nsuccessor activity with respect to the predecessor activity, and lags are used in limited circumstances where processes\\nrequire a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact.\\n\\n214 \\n6.5.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREION\\n\\nSchedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing the\\nproject scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful technique\\nis the negative float analysis. The critical path is the one with the least float. Due to violating a constraint or imposed\\ndate, the total float can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 619 and include:\\n\\n Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.\\nExamples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite delivery\\nto activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resources\\nwill shorten the activity’s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result in\\nincreased risk and/or cost.\\n\\n Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence\\nare performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a\\nbuilding before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increased\\nrisk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the critical\\npath. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activities\\nconcerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.\\n\\n215\\n6.5.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that expedites\\nthe process of building a schedule model by generating start and finish dates based on the inputs of activities, network\\ndiagrams, resources, and activity durations.\\n\\n6.5.2.8 AGILE RELEASE PLANNING\\n\\nAgile release planning provides a highlevel summary timeline of the release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months)\\nbased on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product’s evolution. Agile release planning also\\ndetermines the number of iterations or sprints in the release, and allows the product owner and team to decide\\nhow much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals,\\ndependencies, and impediments.\\n\\nSince features represent value to the customer, the timeline provides a more easily understood project schedule\\nas it defines which feature will be available at the end of each iteration, which is exactly the depth of information the\\ncustomer is looking for.\\n\\nFigure 620 shows the relationship among product vision, product roadmap, release planning, and iteration planning.\\n\\n216 \\n6.5.3 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.5.3.1 SCHEDULE BASELINE\\n\\nAschedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal change\\ncontrol procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriate\\nstakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline finish dates. During monitoring and\\ncontrolling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and finish dates to determine if variances haveccurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan.\\n\\n6.5.3.2 PROJECT SCHEDULE\\n\\nThe project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations,ilestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned finish date\\nfor each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resource\\nassignments have been confirmed and scheduled start and finish dates are established. This process usually occurs no\\nlater than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may also\\nbe developed with a defined target start and target finish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented in\\nsummary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Although\\na project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more of\\nthe following formats:\\n\\n Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listedn the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontal\\nbars placed according to start and finish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used.\\nDepending on the audience, float can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, the\\nbroader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependent\\nwork packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 621\\nthat is presented in a WBSstructured format.\\n\\n217\\n Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion ofajor deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 621.\\n\\n Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams are commonly presented in the activityonnode\\ndiagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a pure\\nlogic diagram, as shown in Figure 611, or presented in a timescaled schedule network diagram format that\\nis sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 621. These diagrams, with\\nactivity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path schedule\\nactivities. This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities.\\nAnother presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a timescaled logic diagram. These diagrams\\ninclude a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They areptimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on the\\nsame line of the diagram in sequence.\\n\\nFigure 621 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reported\\nthrough asof date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 621 reflects schedule presentations in\\nthe forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailed\\nschedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 621 also visually shows the relationships among the\\ndifferent levels of detail of the project schedule.\\n\\n218 \\n219\\n6.5.3.3 SCHEDULE DATA\\n\\nThe schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information for describing and controlling the\\nschedule. The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes,\\nand documentation of all identified assumptions and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by application\\narea. Information frequently supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to:\\n\\n Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram;\\n\\n Alternative schedules, such as bestcase or worstcase, not resourceleveled or resourceleveled, or with or\\nwithout imposed dates; and\\n\\n Applied schedule reserves.\\n\\nSchedule data could also include such items as resource histograms, cashflow projections, order and delivery\\nschedules, or other relevant information.\\n\\n6.5.3.4 PROJECT CALENDARS\\n\\nA project calendar identifies working days and shifts that are available for scheduled activities. It distinguishes\\ntime periods in days or parts of days that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are not\\navailable for work. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods for\\nsome activities to calculate the project schedule. The project calendars may be updated.\\n\\n6.5.3.5 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Modifications to the project scope or project schedule may result in change requests\\nto the scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for\\nreview and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions may\\ninclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.\\n\\n220 \\n6.5.3.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change\\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may be updated to\\nreflect a change in the way the schedule was developed and will be managed.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to\\napproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a\\nrevised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.\\n\\n6.5.3.7 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Activity attributes. Described in Section 6.2.3.2. Activity attributes are updated to include any revised resource\\nrequirements and any other revisions generated by the Develop Schedule process.\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log may be updated with changes to assumptions\\nin duration, resource utilization, sequencing, or other information that is revealed as a result of developing the\\nschedule model.\\n\\n Duration estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.1. The number and availability of resources, along with the\\nactivity dependencies can result in a change to the duration estimates. If the resourceleveling analysis changes\\nthe resource requirements, then the duration estimates will likely need to be updated as well.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with\\ntechniques that were efficient and effective in developing the schedule model.\\n\\n Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource leveling can have a significant effect on\\npreliminary estimates for the types and quantities of resources required. If the resourceleveling analysis changes\\nthe resource requirements, then the resource requirements are updated.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may need to be updated to reflect opportunities or\\nthreats perceived through scheduling assumptions.\\n\\n221\\n6.6 CONTROL SCHEDULE\\n\\nControl Schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managing\\nchanges to the schedule baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughout\\nthe project. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this\\nprocess are depicted in Figure 622. Figure 623 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n222 \\nUpdating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. Any change to the schedule baseline\\ncan only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Control Schedule, as a\\ncomponent of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, is concerned with:\\n\\n Determining the current status of the project schedule,\\n Influencing the factors that create schedule changes,\\n Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves,\\n\\n Determining if the project schedule has changed, and\\n\\n Managing the actual changes as they occur.\\n\\n223\\nWhen an agile approach is used, Control Schedule is concerned with:\\n\\n Determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered and\\naccepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle;\\n\\n Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting processes and improving,\\nif required;\\n\\n Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog);\\n\\n Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted (velocity) in the given time\\nper iteration (agreedupon work cycle duration, typically 2 weeks or 1 month);\\n\\n Determining that the project schedule has changed; and\\n Managing the actual changes as they occur.\\n\\nWhen work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means of\\nensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control. Scheduled status reviews and\\nwalkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete.\\n\\n6.6.1 CONTROL SCHEDULE: INPUTS\\n\\n6.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management describes the frequency\\nthat the schedule will be updated, how reserve will be used, and how the schedule will be controlled.\\n\\n Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline is compared with actual results to\\ndetermine if a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions\\ndocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly when monitoring and controlling the schedule\\nbaseline.\\n\\n Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis the\\nperformance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or\\npreventive action is necessary.\\n\\n224 \\n6.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to\\nlater phases in the project to improve schedule control.\\n\\n Project calendars. Described in Section 6.5.3.4. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar\\nto allow for different work periods for some activities to calculate the schedule forecasts.\\n\\n Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Project schedule refers to the most recent version with notations\\nto indicate updates, completed activities, and started activities as of the indicated date.\\n\\n Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars show the availability of team and\\nphysical resources.\\n\\n Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. Schedule data will be reviewed and updated in the Control\\nSchedule process.\\n\\n6.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which activities have\\nstarted, their progress (e.g., actual duration, remaining duration, and physical percent complete), and which activities\\nhave finished.\\n\\n6.6.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Control Schedule process include but are not limited to:\\n Existing formal and informal schedule controlrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines;\\n Schedule control tools; and\\n\\n Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.\\n\\n225\\n6.6.2 CONTROL SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n6.6.2.1 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule performance measurements such as schedule\\nvariance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original\\nschedule baseline.\\n\\n Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. It\\nis used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iteration\\nplanning (see Section 6.4.2.8). A forecast trend line can be used to predict the likely variance at iteration\\ncompletion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the ideal\\nburndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completion\\nbased on remaining work. Figure 624 is an example of an iteration burndown chart.\\n\\n226 \\n Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze schedule performance against\\nthe schedule baseline such as actual start and finish dates, percent complete, and remaining duration for work\\nin progress.\\n\\n Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine\\nwhether performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding\\nperformance to date and for comparing to future performance goals in the form of completion dates.\\n\\n Variance analysis. Variance analysis looks at variances in planned versus actual start and finish dates, planned\\nversus actual durations, and variances in float. Part of variance analysis is determining the cause and degree of\\nvariance relative to the schedule baseline (see Section 6.5.3.1), estimating the implications of those variances\\nfor future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. For example, aajor delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on the overall project schedule, while auch shorter delay on a critical or nearcritical activity may require immediate action.\\n\\n Whatif scenario analysis. Described in Section 6.5.2.4. Whatif scenario analysis is used to assess the various\\nscenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model into\\nalignment with the project management plan and approved baseline.\\n\\n6.6.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHOD\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. The\\nvariance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date. Evaluating the progress of activities on\\nnear critical paths can identify schedule risk.\\n\\n6.6.2.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that provides\\nthe ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, to report variances to and progress made against the schedule\\nbaseline, and to forecast the effects of changes to the project schedule model.\\n\\n6.6.2.4 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.5.2.3. Resource optimization techniques involve the scheduling of activities and the resources\\nrequired by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.\\n\\n227\\n6.6.2.5 LEADS AND LAGS\\n\\nAdjusting leads and lags is applied during network analysis to find ways to bring project activities that are behind into\\nalignment with the plan. For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping can be adjusted to\\nstart before the exterior work of the building is completed by increasing the lead time in the relationship, or a technical\\nwriting team can adjust the start of editing the draft of a large document immediately after the document is written by\\neliminating or decreasing lag time.\\n\\n6.6.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREION\\n\\nSchedule compression techniques (see Section 6.5.2.6) are used to find ways to bring project activities that are\\nbehind into alignment with the plan by fast tracking or crashing the schedule for the remaining work.\\n\\n6.6.3 CONTROL SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS\\n\\n6.6.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work\\nis performing compared to the schedule baseline. Variances in the start and finish dates and the durations can be\\ncalculated at the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, the (SV) and\\n(SPI) are documented for inclusion in work performance reports (see Section 4.5.3.1).\\n\\n6.6.3.2 SCHEDULE FORECASTS\\n\\nSchedule updates are forecasts of estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the projects future based on\\ninformation and knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are updated and reissued based on work\\nperformance information provided as the project is executed. The information is based on the projects past performance\\nand expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions. This can include earned value performance\\nindicators, as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.\\n\\n228 \\n6.6.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Schedule variance analysis, as well as reviews of progress reports, results of performanceeasures, and modifications to the project scope or project schedule, may result in change requests to the schedule\\nbaseline, scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed\\nfor review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions may\\ninclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.\\n\\n6.6.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change\\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan may be updated to\\nreflect a change in the way the schedule is managed.\\n\\n Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated in\\nresponse to approved change requests related to change in project scope, resources, or activity duration\\nestimates.

Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to\\napproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates.\\n\\n Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement\\nbaseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.\\nIn some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the\\nperformance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.\\n\\n229\\n6.6.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\n\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise\\nassumptions on activity sequencing, durations, and productivity.\\n\\n Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise the\\nway duration estimates were developed.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with\\ntechniques that were effective in maintaining the schedule, causes of variances, and corrective actions that were\\nused to respond to schedule variances.\\n\\n Project schedule. An updated project schedule (see Section 6.5.3.2) will be generated from the schedule model\\npopulated with updated schedule data to reflect the schedule changes and manage the project.\\n\\n Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars are updated to reflect changes to\\nthe utilization of resource calendars that were the result of optimizing resources, schedule compression, and\\ncorrective or preventive actions.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register and risk response plans within it, may be updated\\nbased on the risks that may arise due to schedule compression techniques.\\n\\n Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. New project schedule network diagrams may be developed to\\ndisplay approved remaining durations and approved modifications to the schedule. In some cases, project\\nschedule delays can be so severe that a new target schedule with forecasted start and finish dates is needed to\\nprovide realistic data for directing the work, measuring performance, and measuring progress.\\n\\n230 \\n']\n"

The project charter defines the summary milestone schedule that will influence theanagement of the project schedule. | 2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.3.2.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan describes how the scopewill be defined and developed, which will provide information on how the schedule will be developed. Development approach. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The product development approach will help define thescheduling approach, estimating techniques, scheduling tools, and techniques for controlling the schedule. | 3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are notlimited to: Organizational culture and structure, Team resource availability and skills and physical resource availability, Scheduling software, Guidelines and criteria for tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes and procedures to satisfy thespecific needs of the project, and Commercial databases, such as standardized estimating data. | 4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are notlimited to: Historical information and lessons learned repositories; Existing formal and informal schedule development, management and controlrelated policies, procedures,and guidelines; Templates and forms; and Monitoring and reporting tools.180 6.1.2 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in previous, similar projects: Schedule development, management, and control; Scheduling methodologies (e.g., predictive or adaptive life cycle); Scheduling software; and The specific industry for which the project is developed. | 2 DATA ANALYSISA data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.Alternatives analysis can include determining which schedule methodology to use, or how to combine variousethods on the project. It can also include determining how detailed the schedule needs to be, the duration ofwaves for rolling wave planning, and how often it should be reviewed and updated. An appropriate balance betweenthe level of detail needed to manage the schedule and the amount of time it takes to keep it up to date needs to bereached for each project. | 3 MEETINGSProject teams may hold planning meetings to develop the schedule management plan. Participants at these meetingsay include the project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyonewith responsibility for schedule planning or execution, and others as needed.6.1.3 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS | 1 SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLANThe schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteriaand the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management plan may beformal or informal, highly detailed, or broadly framed based on the needs of the project, and includes appropriatecontrol thresholds.181The schedule management plan can establish the following:Project schedule model development. The scheduling methodology and the scheduling tool to be used in thedevelopment of the project schedule model are specified.Release and iteration length. When using an adaptive life cycle, the timeboxed periods for releases, waves,and iterations are specified. Timeboxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily towardcompletion of a goal. Timeboxing helps to minimize scope creep as it forces the teams to process essentialfeatures first, then other features when time permits.Level of accuracy. The level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining realistic activityduration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies.Units of measure. Each unit of measurement (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures, oreters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures) is defined for each of the resources.Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the frameworkfor the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates and resulting schedules.Project schedule model maintenance. The process used to update the status and record progress of theproject in the schedule model during the execution of the project is defined.Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be specified to indicate anagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typicallyexpressed as percentage deviations from the parameters established in the baseline plan.Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules or other physical measurementrules of performance measurement are set. For example, the schedule management plan may specify: Rules for establishing percent complete, EVM techniques (e.g., baselines, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to be employed (for more specificinformation, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value Management [17]), and Schedule performance measurements such as schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI)used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original schedule baseline.Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined.1826.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIESDefine Activities is the process of identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to producethe project deliverables. The key benefit of this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activitiesthat provide a basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, monitoring, and controlling the project work. This processis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted inFigure 65. Figure 66 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.1836.2.1 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS | 1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The schedule management plan defines theschedule methodology, the duration of waves for rolling wave planning, and the level of detail necessary toanage the work. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptionsdocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while defining activities. | 2 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSEnterprise environmental factors that influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to: Organizational cultures and structure, Published commercial information from commercial databases, and Project management information system (PMIS). | 3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned repository containing historical information regarding activity lists used by previous similar projects, Standardized processes, Templates that contain a standard activity list or a portion of an activity list from a previous project, and Existing formal and informal activity planningrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the schedulingethodology, that are considered in developing the activity definitions.6.2.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledgef similar past projects and the work being performed.184  | 2 DECOMPOSITIONDescribed in Section 5.4.2.2. Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope andproject deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. Activities represent the effort needed to complete a workpackage. The Define Activities process defines the final outputs as activities rather than deliverables, as done in theCreate WBS process (Section 5.4).The activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently, with the WBS and WBSdictionary used as the basis for development of the final activity list. Each work package within the WBS is decomposedinto the activities required to produce the work package deliverables. Involving team members in the decomposition canlead to better and more accurate results. | 3 ROLLING WAVE PLANNINGRolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term isplanned in detail, while work further in the future is planned at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaborationapplicable to work packages, planning packages, and release planning when using an agile or waterfall approach.Therefore, work can exist at various levels of detail depending on where it is in the project life cycle. During earlystrategic planning when information is less defined, work packages may be decomposed to the known level of detail. Asore is known about the upcoming events in the near term, work packages can be decomposed into activities. | 4 MEETINGSMeetings may be facetoface, virtual, formal, or informal. Meetings may be held with team members or subjectatter experts to define the activities needed to complete the work.6.2.3 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS | 1 ACTIVITY LISTThe activity list includes the schedule activities required on the project. For projects that use rolling wave planningr agile techniques, the activity list will be updated periodically as the project progresses. The activity list includesan activity identifier and a scope of work description for each activity in sufficient detail to ensure that project teamembers understand what work is required to be completed.185 | 2 ACTIVITY ATTRIBUTESActivity attributes extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated with eachactivity. The components for each activity evolve over time. During the initial stages of the project, they includethe unique activity identifier (ID), WBS ID, and activity label or name. When completed, they may include activitydescriptions, predecessor activities, successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags (Section  | 3),resource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify theplace where the work has to be performed, the project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effortinvolved. Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the plannedschedule activities in various ways within reports | 3 MILESTONE LISTA milestone is a significant point or event in a project. A milestone list identifies all project milestones and indicateswhether the milestone is mandatory, such as those required by contract, or optional, such as those based on historicalinformation. Milestones have zero duration because they represent a significant point or event. | 4 CHANGE REQUESTSDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Once the project has been baselined, the progressive elaboration of deliverables intoactivities may reveal work that was not initially part of the project baselines. This may result in a change request.Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process(Section 4.6). | 5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a changerequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Throughout the project, work packages are progressivelyelaborated into activities. This process may reveal work that was not part of the initial schedule baseline,necessitating a change to delivery dates or other significant schedule milestones that are part of theschedule baseline. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response toapproved changes in schedule activities.186 6.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIESSequence Activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities. The keybenefit of this process is that it defines the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efficiency given all projectconstraints. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of thisprocess are depicted in Figure 67. Figure 68 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.187Every activity except the first and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successoractivity with an appropriate logical relationship. Logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic projectschedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable projectschedule. Sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automatedtechniques. The Sequence Activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram toact as a first step to publish the schedule baseline.6.3.1 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS | 1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The schedule management plan defines the methodused and the level of accuracy along with other criteria required to sequence activities. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptionsdocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while sequencing activities. | 2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section  | 2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence ofevents or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationshipsbetween the activities. Activity list. Described in Section  | 1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the projectthat are to be sequenced. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence the sequencingf the activities. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log mayinfluence the way activities are sequenced, the relationship between activities, and the need for leads and lags,and may give rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule. Milestone list. Described in Section  | 3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestones,which may influence the way activities are sequenced.188  | 3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to: Government or industry standards, Project management information system (PMIS), Scheduling tools, and Organization work authorization systems. | 4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to: Portfolio and program plans and project dependencies and relationships; Existing formal and informal activity planningrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the schedulingethodology that is considered in developing logical relationships; Templates that can be used to expedite the preparation of networks for project activities. Related activity attributesinformation in templates can also contain additional descriptive information useful in sequencing activities; and Lessons learned repository containing historical information that can help optimize the sequencing process.6.3.2 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 PRECEDENCE DIAGRAMMING METHODThe precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activitiesare represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in whichthe activities are to be performed.PDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that logicallycomes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes afteranother activity in a schedule. These relationships are defined below and are illustrated in Figure 69:189 Finishtostart (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activityhas finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardwareis assembled (predecessor). Finishtofinish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activityhas finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to finish before editing the document(successor) can finish. Starttostart (). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activityhas started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins. Starttofinish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activityhas started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) has to start before the old accountspayable system can be shut down (predecessor).In PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, butis included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.Two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example,  and FF). Multiple relationshipsbetween the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with thehighest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.190  | 2 DEPENDENCY DETERMINATION AND INTEGRATIONDependencies may be characterized by the following attributes: mandatory or discretionary, internal or external(as described below). Dependency has four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the followingways: mandatory external dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, ordiscretionary internal dependencies. Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required orinherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations, such as on aconstruction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built,r on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependenciesare sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory.The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities.Mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool. Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic,preferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of bestpractices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequenceis desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted bestpractices recommend that during construction, the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbingwork. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performingthe activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fullydocumented since they can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling options. When fasttracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered forodification or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the processf sequencing the activities.191 External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and nonproject activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control. For example, thetesting activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, orgovernmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a constructionproject. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process ofsequencing the activities. Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities andare generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assembleit, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependenciesare internal during the process of sequencing the activities. | 3 LEADS AND LAGSA lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,n a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduledpunch list completion. This would be shown as a finishtostart with a 2week lead as shown in Figure 610. Lead is oftenrepresented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.192 A lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can beshown as a starttostart relationship with a 15day lag as shown in Figure 610. Lag can also be represented in projectschedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 611 in the relationship between activities H and / (as indicated by thenomenclature +10 (starttostart plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale).The project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately define thelogical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Also, duration estimates do not includeany leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions should be documented. | 4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems includes scheduling software that has thecapability to help plan, organize, and adjust the sequence of the activities; insert the logical relationships, lead and lagvalues; and differentiate the different types of dependencies.1936.3.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS | 1 PROJECT SCHEDULE NETWORK DIAGRAMSA project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to asdependencies, among the project schedule activities. Figure 611 illustrates a project schedule network diagram. Aproject schedule network diagram is produced manually or by using project management software. It can include fullproject details, or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describethe basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fullydescribed within the narrative.Activities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have multiple successoractivities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence are at greater risk as they are affectedby multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity PIPE is called a path convergence, as it has more than onepredecessor, while activity K is called a path divergence, as it has more than one successor. | 2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section  | 2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence ofevents or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationshipsbetween the activities. Activity list. Described in Section  | 1. The activity list may be impacted by the change in relationshipsamong the project activities during the sequencing activities. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log mayneed to be updated based on the sequencing, relationship determination, and leads and lags, and may give riseto individual project risks that may impact the project schedule. Milestone list. Described in Section  | 3. The scheduled dates for specific milestones may be impacted bychanges in relationships among the project activities during the sequencing activities.194 6.4 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONSEstimate Activity Durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individualactivities with estimated resources. The key benefit of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activitywill take to complete. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs ofthis process are depicted in Figure 612. Figure 613 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.195Estimating activity durations uses information from the scope of work, required resource types or skill levels,estimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may influence the duration estimates includeconstraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., fixed duration, fixed effort or work, fixednumber of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of durationriginate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the specificactivity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of theinput data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work,the accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.196 The Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to completethe activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity. These estimates are used toapproximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate projectand resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish anactivity, along with the skill proficiency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a drivingresource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple “straightline” orlinear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved,r number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation(e.g., a 24hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include: Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce aunit of work is increased while all other factors remain fixed, a point will eventually be reached at which additionsf that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output. Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources doesnot always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point addingtoo many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additionalcoordination, and other factors involved. Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, anincrease in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology,which may impact duration and resource needs. Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—or procrastination—when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Lawwhere work expands to fill the time available for its completion.All data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate.1976.4.1 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: INPUTS | 1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The schedule management plan defines the methodused, as well as the level of accuracy and other criteria required to estimate activity durations. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the WBS dictionary, which containstechnical details that can influence the effort and duration estimates. | 2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section  | 2. Activity attributes may describe defined predecessor orsuccessor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships between the activities that mayimpact duration estimates. Activity list. Described in Section  | 1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on theproject, which are to be estimated. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence theduration estimates. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log maygive rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard toeffort and duration estimating can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precisionf effort and duration estimates. Milestone list. Described in Section  | 3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestonesthat may impact the duration estimates. Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project is staffed when the appropriate peoplehave been assigned to the team. Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. The resource breakdown structure provides ahierarchical structure of the identified resources by resource category and resource type.198  Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars influence the duration of scheduleactivities due to the availability of specific resources, type of resources, and resources with specific attributes.Resource calendars specify when and how long identified project resources will be available during the project. Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The estimated activity resource requirements will havean effect on the duration of the activity, since the level to which the resources assigned to the activity meetthe requirements will significantly influence the duration of most activities. For example, if additional or lowerskilled resources are assigned to an activity, there may be reduced efficiency or productivity due to increasedcommunication, training, and coordination needs leading to a longer duration estimate. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Individual project risks may impact resource selection andavailability. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates, described in Section11.5.3.2, from Plan Risk Responses. | 3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are notlimited to: Duration estimating databases and other reference data, Productivity metrics, Published commercial information, and Location of team members. | 4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are notlimited to: Historical duration information, Project calendars, Estimating policies, Scheduling methodology, and Lessons learned repository.1996.4.2 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics: Schedule development, management, and control; Expertise in estimating; and Discipline or application knowledge. | 2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATINGAnalogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historicaldata from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such asduration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a futureproject. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basisfor estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for knowndifferences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration whenthere is a limited amount of detailed information about the project.Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less timeconsuming than other techniques, but it is alsoless accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and maybe used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previousactivities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimateshave the needed expertise. | 3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATINGParametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration basedn historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical dataand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost,budget, and duration.200 Durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of laborhours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied bythe number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of laborhours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required toinstall 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built intothe model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunctionwith other estimating methods. | 4 THREEPOINT ESTIMATINGThe accuracy of singlepoint duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk.Using threepoint estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity’s duration: Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned,their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, andinterruptions. Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity. Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE,can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:tE (tO + iM + tP)/ 3.Triangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental data. Durationestimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range ofuncertainty around the expected duration.201 | 5 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATINGBottomup estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lowerlevel components of the WBS. When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence,the work wihin the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates arethen aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependenciesbetween theusage is ref that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resourcelected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity. | 6 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills;scheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated);and make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, andduration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work. Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserveneeded for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedulereserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedulebaseline, which is allocated for identified risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with theknownunknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingencyreserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a fixed number of work periods. Contingencyreserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about theproject becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should beclearly identified in the schedule documentation.Estimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Managementreserves are a specified amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and arereserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to addressthe unknownunknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline,but it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of managementreserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.202  | 7 DECISION MAKINGDescribed in Section 5.2.2.4. Decisionmaking techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limitedto voting. One variation of the voting method that is often used in agilebased projects is called the fist of five (also calledfist to five). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holdingup a closed fist (indicating no support) up to five fingers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer thanthree fingers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project managercontinues the fistoffive process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more fingers) or agreesto move on to the next decision. | 8 MEETINGSThe project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessaryto conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decidewhich of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to lowlevel tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacityver the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the first day of the iteration and is attended by the productwner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well asassumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions.6.4.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: OUTPUTS | 1 DURATION ESTIMATESDuration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to completean activity, a phase, or a project. Duration estimates do not include any lags as described in Section  | 3. Durationestimates may include some indication of the range of possible results. For example: A range of 2 weeks + 2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and not more than 12(assuming a 5day work week); or A 15% probability of exceeding 3 weeks, which indicates a high probability—85%—that the activity will take3 weeks or less.203 | 2 BASIS OF ESTIMATESThe amount and type of additional details supporting the duration estimate vary by application area. Regardless ofthe level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the durationestimate was derived.Supporting detail for duration estimates may include: Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed), Documentation of all assumptions made, Documentation of any known constraints, Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., +10%) to indicate that the duration is estimated between arange of values), Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate, and Documentation of individual project risks influencing this estimate. | 3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section  | 2. Activity duration estimates produced during this process aredocumented as part of the activity attributes. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. This includes assumptions made in developing the durationestimate, such as resource skill levels and availability, as well as a basis of estimates for durations. Additionally,constraints arising out of the scheduling methodology and scheduling tool are also documented. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated withtechniques that were efficient and effective in developing effort and duration estimates.204 6.5 DEVELOP SCHEDULEDevelop Schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and scheduleconstraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling. The key benefit of thisprocess is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities. This processis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted inFigure 614. Figure 615 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.205206 Developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The schedule model is used to determine theplanned start and finish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information. Scheduledevelopment can require the review and revision of duration estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves toestablish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress. Key steps include defining theproject milestones, identifying and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and finishdates have been determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assignedactivities. The staff confirms that the start and finish dates present no conflict with resource calendars or assignedactivities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed to determine conflicts withlogical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined. Revising andaintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project,as described in Section 6.7.For more specific information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling.6.5.1 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: INPUTS6.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1.

The risk register provides the details of all identified risks, and theircharacteristics, that affect the schedule model. Risk information relevant to the schedule is reflected in schedulereserves using the expected or mean risk impact.6.5.1.3 AGREEMENTSDescribed in Section 12.2.3.2. Vendors may have an input to the project schedule as they develop the details of howthey will perform the project work to meet contractual commitments.208 6.5.1.4 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Develop Schedule process include but are not limited to: Government or industry standards, and Communication channels.6.5.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Develop Schedule process include but are not limited to: Scheduling methodology containing the policies governing schedule model development and maintenance,and Project calendar(s).6.5.2 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES6.5.2.1 SCHEDULE NETWORK ANALYSISSchedule network analysis is the overarching technique used to generate the project schedule model. It employsseveral other techniques such as critical path method (described in Section 6.5.2.2), resource optimization techniques(described in Section 6.5.2.3), and modeling techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.4). Additional analysis includes butis not limited to: Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiplepaths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time, to reduce theprobability of a schedule slip. Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has highrisk activities or long lead items that would necessitateuse of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path.Schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed.2096.5.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHODThe critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of scheduleflexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. This schedule network analysis technique calculatesthe early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitationsby performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 616. In thisexample, the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and therefore the sequence of ACD is the critical path.The critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determinesthe shortest possible project duration. The longest path has the least total float—usually zero. The resulting earlyand late start and finish dates are not necessarily the project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods withinwhich the activity could be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logicalrelationships, leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path(s)and the amount of total and free float or schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.On any network path, the total float or schedule flexibility is measured by the amount of time that a scheduleactivity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date or violating aschedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total float on the critical path. As implementedwith the precedence diagramming method sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total floatdepending on the constraints applied. Positive total float is caused when the backward pass is calculated from aschedule constraint that is later than the early finish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation.Negative total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative floatanalysis is a technique that helps to find possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track.Schedule networks may have multiple nearcritical paths. Many software packages allow the user to define theparameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments to activity durations (when more resources or lessscope can be arranged), logical relationships (when the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads andlags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total float.Once the total float and the free float have been calculated, the free float is the amount of time that a scheduleactivity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. Forexample the free float for Activity B, in Figure 616, is 5 days.210 6.5.2.3 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATIONResource optimization is used to adjust the start and finish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to beequal to or less than resource availability. Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust theschedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to: Resource leveling. A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints withthe goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used whenshared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are overallocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (asshown in Figure 617), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can oftencause the original critical path to change. Available float is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the criticalpath through the project schedule may change. Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements forresources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed toresource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In otherwords, activities may only be delayed within their free and total float. Resource smoothing may not be able toptimize all resources.211212 6.5.2.4 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Whatif scenario analysis. Whatif scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predicttheir effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, “What if the situationrepresented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to computethe different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending specific engineering durations,r introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the whatifscenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and inpreparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations. Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertaintyto evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique isMonte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculatepossible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating multiple work package durationswith different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributionsand other representations of uncertainty (see Section 11.4.2.4). Figure 618 shows a probability distribution for aproject with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project finish date). In this example, there is a10% probability that the project will finish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probabilityf completing the project by May 28.213For more information on how Monte Carlo simulation is used for schedule models, see the Practice Standardfor Scheduling.6.5.2.5 LEADS AND LAGSDescribed in Section  | 3. Leads and lags are refinements applied during network analysis to develop a viableschedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. Leads are used in limited circumstances to advance asuccessor activity with respect to the predecessor activity, and lags are used in limited circumstances where processesrequire a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact.214 6.5.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREIONSchedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing theproject scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful techniqueis the negative float analysis. The critical path is the one with the least float. Due to violating a constraint or imposeddate, the total float can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 619 and include: Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite deliveryto activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resourceswill shorten the activity’s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result inincreased risk and/or cost. Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequenceare performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for abuilding before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increasedrisk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the criticalpath. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activitiesconcerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.2156.5.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that expeditesthe process of building a schedule model by generating start and finish dates based on the inputs of activities, networkdiagrams, resources, and activity durations.6.5.2.8 AGILE RELEASE PLANNINGAgile release planning provides a highlevel summary timeline of the release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months)based on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product’s evolution. Agile release planning alsodetermines the number of iterations or sprints in the release, and allows the product owner and team to decidehow much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals,dependencies, and impediments.Since features represent value to the customer, the timeline provides a more easily understood project scheduleas it defines which feature will be available at the end of each iteration, which is exactly the depth of information thecustomer is looking for.Figure 620 shows the relationship among product vision, product roadmap, release planning, and iteration planning.216 6.5.3 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS6.5.3.1 SCHEDULE BASELINEAschedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal changecontrol procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriatestakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline finish dates. During monitoring andcontrolling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and finish dates to determine if variances haveccurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan.6.5.3.2 PROJECT SCHEDULEThe project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations,ilestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned finish datefor each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resourceassignments have been confirmed and scheduled start and finish dates are established. This process usually occurs nolater than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may alsobe developed with a defined target start and target finish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented insummary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Althougha project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more ofthe following formats: Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listedn the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontalbars placed according to start and finish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used.Depending on the audience, float can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, thebroader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependentwork packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 621that is presented in a WBSstructured format.217 Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion ofajor deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 621. Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams are commonly presented in the activityonnodediagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a purelogic diagram, as shown in Figure 611, or presented in a timescaled schedule network diagram format thatis sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 621. These diagrams, withactivity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path scheduleactivities. This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities.Another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a timescaled logic diagram. These diagramsinclude a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They areptimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on thesame line of the diagram in sequence.Figure 621 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reportedthrough asof date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 621 reflects schedule presentations inthe forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailedschedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 621 also visually shows the relationships among thedifferent levels of detail of the project schedule.218 2196.5.3.3 SCHEDULE DATAThe schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information for describing and controlling theschedule. The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes,and documentation of all identified assumptions and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by applicationarea. Information frequently supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to: Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram; Alternative schedules, such as bestcase or worstcase, not resourceleveled or resourceleveled, or with orwithout imposed dates; and Applied schedule reserves.Schedule data could also include such items as resource histograms, cashflow projections, order and deliveryschedules, or other relevant information.6.5.3.4 PROJECT CALENDARSA project calendar identifies working days and shifts that are available for scheduled activities. It distinguishestime periods in days or parts of days that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are notavailable for work. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods forsome activities to calculate the project schedule. The project calendars may be updated.6.5.3.5 CHANGE REQUESTSDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Modifications to the project scope or project schedule may result in change requeststo the scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed forreview and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions mayinclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.220 6.5.3.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a changerequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The schedule management plan may be updated toreflect a change in the way the schedule was developed and will be managed. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response toapproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that arevised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.6.5.3.7 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section  | 2. Activity attributes are updated to include any revised resourcerequirements and any other revisions generated by the Develop Schedule process. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log may be updated with changes to assumptionsin duration, resource utilization, sequencing, or other information that is revealed as a result of developing theschedule model. Duration estimates. Described in Section  | 1. The number and availability of resources, along with theactivity dependencies can result in a change to the duration estimates. If the resourceleveling analysis changesthe resource requirements, then the duration estimates will likely need to be updated as well. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated withtechniques that were efficient and effective in developing the schedule model. Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource leveling can have a significant effect onpreliminary estimates for the types and quantities of resources required. If the resourceleveling analysis changesthe resource requirements, then the resource requirements are updated. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may need to be updated to reflect opportunities orthreats perceived through scheduling assumptions.2216.6 CONTROL SCHEDULEControl Schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managingchanges to the schedule baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughoutthe project. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of thisprocess are depicted in Figure 622. Figure 623 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.222 Updating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. Any change to the schedule baselinecan only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Control Schedule, as acomponent of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, is concerned with: Determining the current status of the project schedule, Influencing the factors that create schedule changes, Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves, Determining if the project schedule has changed, and Managing the actual changes as they occur.223When an agile approach is used, Control Schedule is concerned with: Determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered andaccepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle; Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting processes and improving,if required; Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog); Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted (velocity) in the given timeper iteration (agreedupon work cycle duration, typically 2 weeks or 1 month); Determining that the project schedule has changed; and Managing the actual changes as they occur.When work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means ofensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control. Scheduled status reviews andwalkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete.6.6.1 CONTROL SCHEDULE: INPUTS6.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The schedule management describes the frequencythat the schedule will be updated, how reserve will be used, and how the schedule will be controlled. Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline is compared with actual results todetermine if a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptionsdocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly when monitoring and controlling the schedulebaseline. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis theperformance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, orpreventive action is necessary.224 6.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied tolater phases in the project to improve schedule control. Project calendars. Described in Section 6.5.3.4. A schedule model may require more than one project calendarto allow for different work periods for some activities to calculate the schedule forecasts. Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Project schedule refers to the most recent version with notationsto indicate updates, completed activities, and started activities as of the indicated date. Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars show the availability of team andphysical resources. Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. Schedule data will be reviewed and updated in the ControlSchedule process.6.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE DATADescribed in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which activities havestarted, their progress (e.g., actual duration, remaining duration, and physical percent complete), and which activitieshave finished.6.6.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Control Schedule process include but are not limited to: Existing formal and informal schedule controlrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines; Schedule control tools; and Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.2256.6.2 CONTROL SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES6.6.2.1 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule performance measurements such as schedulevariance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the originalschedule baseline. Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. Itis used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iterationplanning (see Section  | 8). A forecast trend line can be used to predict the likely variance at iterationcompletion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the idealburndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completionbased on remaining work. Figure 624 is an example of an iteration burndown chart.226  Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze schedule performance againstthe schedule baseline such as actual start and finish dates, percent complete, and remaining duration for workin progress. Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determinewhether performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understandingperformance to date and for comparing to future performance goals in the form of completion dates. Variance analysis. Variance analysis looks at variances in planned versus actual start and finish dates, plannedversus actual durations, and variances in float. Part of variance analysis is determining the cause and degree ofvariance relative to the schedule baseline (see Section 6.5.3.1), estimating the implications of those variancesfor future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. For example, aajor delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on the overall project schedule, while auch shorter delay on a critical or nearcritical activity may require immediate action. Whatif scenario analysis. Described in Section 6.5.2.4. Whatif scenario analysis is used to assess the variousscenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model intoalignment with the project management plan and approved baseline.6.6.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHODDescribed in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. Thevariance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date. Evaluating the progress of activities onnear critical paths can identify schedule risk.6.6.2.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that providesthe ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, to report variances to and progress made against the schedulebaseline, and to forecast the effects of changes to the project schedule model.6.6.2.4 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATIONDescribed in Section 6.5.2.3. Resource optimization techniques involve the scheduling of activities and the resourcesrequired by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.2276.6.2.5 LEADS AND LAGSAdjusting leads and lags is applied during network analysis to find ways to bring project activities that are behind intoalignment with the plan. For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping can be adjusted tostart before the exterior work of the building is completed by increasing the lead time in the relationship, or a technicalwriting team can adjust the start of editing the draft of a large document immediately after the document is written byeliminating or decreasing lag time.6.6.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREIONSchedule compression techniques (see Section 6.5.2.6) are used to find ways to bring project activities that arebehind into alignment with the plan by fast tracking or crashing the schedule for the remaining work.6.6.3 CONTROL SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS6.6.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATIONDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project workis performing compared to the schedule baseline. Variances in the start and finish dates and the durations can becalculated at the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, the (SV) and(SPI) are documented for inclusion in work performance reports (see Section 4.5.3.1).6.6.3.2 SCHEDULE FORECASTSSchedule updates are forecasts of estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the projects future based oninformation and knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are updated and reissued based on workperformance information provided as the project is executed. The information is based on the projects past performanceand expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions. This can include earned value performanceindicators, as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.228 6.6.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTSDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Schedule variance analysis, as well as reviews of progress reports, results of performanceeasures, and modifications to the project scope or project schedule, may result in change requests to the schedulebaseline, scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processedfor review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions mayinclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.6.6.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a changerequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The schedule management plan may be updated toreflect a change in the way the schedule is managed. Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated inresponse to approved change requests related to change in project scope, resources, or activity durationestimates. The schedule baseline may be updated to reflect changes caused by schedule compressiontechniques or performance issues. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response toapproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurementbaseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.In some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise theperformance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.2296.6.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to reviseassumptions on activity sequencing, durations, and productivity. Basis of estimates. Described in Section  | 2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise theway duration estimates were developed. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated withtechniques that were effective in maintaining the schedule, causes of variances, and corrective actions that wereused to respond to schedule variances. Project schedule. An updated project schedule (see Section 6.5.3.2) will be generated from the schedule modelpopulated with updated schedule data to reflect the schedule changes and manage the project. Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars are updated to reflect changes tothe utilization of resource calendars that were the result of optimizing resources, schedule compression, andcorrective or preventive actions. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register and risk response plans within it, may be updatedbased on the risks that may arise due to schedule compression techniques. Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. New project schedule network diagrams may be developed todisplay approved remaining durations and approved modifications to the schedule. In some cases, projectschedule delays can be so severe that a new target schedule with forecasted start and finish dates is needed toprovide realistic data for directing the work, measuring performance, and measuring progress.230 ']"

       "' | 1 PROJECT CHARTERDescribed in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter defines the summary milestone schedule that will influence theanagement of the project schedule. | 2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.3.2.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Scope management plan. Described in Section 5.1.3.1. The scope management plan describes how the scopewill be defined and developed, which will provide information on how the schedule will be developed. Development approach. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The product development approach will help define thescheduling approach, estimating techniques, scheduling tools, and techniques for controlling the schedule. | 3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are notlimited to: Organizational culture and structure, Team resource availability and skills and physical resource availability, Scheduling software, Guidelines and criteria for tailoring the organization’s set of standard processes and procedures to satisfy thespecific needs of the project, and Commercial databases, such as standardized estimating data. | 4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Schedule Management process include but are notlimited to: Historical information and lessons learned repositories; Existing formal and informal schedule development, management and controlrelated policies, procedures,and guidelines; Templates and forms; and Monitoring and reporting tools.180 6.1.2 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in previous, similar projects: Schedule development, management, and control; Scheduling methodologies (e.g., predictive or adaptive life cycle); Scheduling software; and The specific industry for which the project is developed. | 2 DATA ANALYSISA data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.Alternatives analysis can include determining which schedule methodology to use, or how to combine variousethods on the project. It can also include determining how detailed the schedule needs to be, the duration ofwaves for rolling wave planning, and how often it should be reviewed and updated. An appropriate balance betweenthe level of detail needed to manage the schedule and the amount of time it takes to keep it up to date needs to bereached for each project. | 3 MEETINGSProject teams may hold planning meetings to develop the schedule management plan. Participants at these meetingsay include the project manager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyonewith responsibility for schedule planning or execution, and others as needed.6.1.3 PLAN SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS | 1 SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLANThe schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteriaand the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management plan may beformal or informal, highly detailed, or broadly framed based on the needs of the project, and includes appropriatecontrol thresholds.181The schedule management plan can establish the following:Project schedule model development. The scheduling methodology and the scheduling tool to be used in thedevelopment of the project schedule model are specified.Release and iteration length. When using an adaptive life cycle, the timeboxed periods for releases, waves,and iterations are specified. Timeboxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily towardcompletion of a goal. Timeboxing helps to minimize scope creep as it forces the teams to process essentialfeatures first, then other features when time permits.Level of accuracy. The level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining realistic activityduration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies.Units of measure. Each unit of measurement (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures, oreters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures) is defined for each of the resources.Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the frameworkfor the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates and resulting schedules.Project schedule model maintenance. The process used to update the status and record progress of theproject in the schedule model during the execution of the project is defined.Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be specified to indicate anagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typicallyexpressed as percentage deviations from the parameters established in the baseline plan.Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules or other physical measurementrules of performance measurement are set. For example, the schedule management plan may specify: Rules for establishing percent complete, EVM techniques (e.g., baselines, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to be employed (for more specificinformation, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value Management [17]), and Schedule performance measurements such as schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI)used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original schedule baseline.Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined.1826.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIESDefine Activities is the process of identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to producethe project deliverables. The key benefit of this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activitiesthat provide a basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, monitoring, and controlling the project work. This processis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted inFigure 65. Figure 66 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.1836.2.1 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS | 1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The schedule management plan defines theschedule methodology, the duration of waves for rolling wave planning, and the level of detail necessary toanage the work. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptionsdocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while defining activities. | 2 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSEnterprise environmental factors that influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to: Organizational cultures and structure, Published commercial information from commercial databases, and Project management information system (PMIS). | 3 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Define Activities process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned repository containing historical information regarding activity lists used by previous similar projects, Standardized processes, Templates that contain a standard activity list or a portion of an activity list from a previous project, and Existing formal and informal activity planningrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the schedulingethodology, that are considered in developing the activity definitions.6.2.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledgef similar past projects and the work being performed.184  | 2 DECOMPOSITIONDescribed in Section 5.4.2.2. Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope andproject deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. Activities represent the effort needed to complete a workpackage. The Define Activities process defines the final outputs as activities rather than deliverables, as done in theCreate WBS process (Section 5.4).The activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently, with the WBS and WBSdictionary used as the basis for development of the final activity list. Each work package within the WBS is decomposedinto the activities required to produce the work package deliverables. Involving team members in the decomposition canlead to better and more accurate results. | 3 ROLLING WAVE PLANNINGRolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term isplanned in detail, while work further in the future is planned at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaborationapplicable to work packages, planning packages, and release planning when using an agile or waterfall approach.Therefore, work can exist at various levels of detail depending on where it is in the project life cycle. During earlystrategic planning when information is less defined, work packages may be decomposed to the known level of detail. Asore is known about the upcoming events in the near term, work packages can be decomposed into activities. | 4 MEETINGSMeetings may be facetoface, virtual, formal, or informal. Meetings may be held with team members or subjectatter experts to define the activities needed to complete the work.6.2.3 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS | 1 ACTIVITY LISTThe activity list includes the schedule activities required on the project. For projects that use rolling wave planningr agile techniques, the activity list will be updated periodically as the project progresses. The activity list includesan activity identifier and a scope of work description for each activity in sufficient detail to ensure that project teamembers understand what work is required to be completed.185 | 2 ACTIVITY ATTRIBUTESActivity attributes extend the description of the activity by identifying multiple components associated with eachactivity. The components for each activity evolve over time. During the initial stages of the project, they includethe unique activity identifier (ID), WBS ID, and activity label or name. When completed, they may include activitydescriptions, predecessor activities, successor activities, logical relationships, leads and lags (Section  | 3),resource requirements, imposed dates, constraints, and assumptions. Activity attributes can be used to identify theplace where the work has to be performed, the project calendar the activity is assigned to, and the type of effortinvolved. Activity attributes are used for schedule development and for selecting, ordering, and sorting the plannedschedule activities in various ways within reports | 3 MILESTONE LISTA milestone is a significant point or event in a project. A milestone list identifies all project milestones and indicateswhether the milestone is mandatory, such as those required by contract, or optional, such as those based on historicalinformation. Milestones have zero duration because they represent a significant point or event. | 4 CHANGE REQUESTSDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Once the project has been baselined, the progressive elaboration of deliverables intoactivities may reveal work that was not initially part of the project baselines. This may result in a change request.Change requests are processed for review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process(Section 4.6). | 5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a changerequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Throughout the project, work packages are progressivelyelaborated into activities. This process may reveal work that was not part of the initial schedule baseline,necessitating a change to delivery dates or other significant schedule milestones that are part of theschedule baseline. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response toapproved changes in schedule activities.186 6.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIESSequence Activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities. The keybenefit of this process is that it defines the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efficiency given all projectconstraints. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of thisprocess are depicted in Figure 67. Figure 68 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.187Every activity except the first and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successoractivity with an appropriate logical relationship. Logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic projectschedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable projectschedule. Sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automatedtechniques. The Sequence Activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram toact as a first step to publish the schedule baseline.6.3.1 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS | 1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The schedule management plan defines the methodused and the level of accuracy along with other criteria required to sequence activities. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptionsdocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly while sequencing activities. | 2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section  | 2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence ofevents or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationshipsbetween the activities. Activity list. Described in Section  | 1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on the projectthat are to be sequenced. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence the sequencingf the activities. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log mayinfluence the way activities are sequenced, the relationship between activities, and the need for leads and lags,and may give rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule. Milestone list. Described in Section  | 3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestones,which may influence the way activities are sequenced.188  | 3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to: Government or industry standards, Project management information system (PMIS), Scheduling tools, and Organization work authorization systems. | 4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Sequence Activities process include but are not limited to: Portfolio and program plans and project dependencies and relationships; Existing formal and informal activity planningrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines, such as the schedulingethodology that is considered in developing logical relationships; Templates that can be used to expedite the preparation of networks for project activities. Related activity attributesinformation in templates can also contain additional descriptive information useful in sequencing activities; and Lessons learned repository containing historical information that can help optimize the sequencing process.6.3.2 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 PRECEDENCE DIAGRAMMING METHODThe precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activitiesare represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in whichthe activities are to be performed.PDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that logicallycomes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes afteranother activity in a schedule. These relationships are defined below and are illustrated in Figure 69:189 Finishtostart (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activityhas finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardwareis assembled (predecessor). Finishtofinish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activityhas finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to finish before editing the document(successor) can finish. Starttostart (). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activityhas started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins. Starttofinish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activityhas started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) has to start before the old accountspayable system can be shut down (predecessor).In PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, butis included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.Two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example,  and FF). Multiple relationshipsbetween the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with thehighest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.190  | 2 DEPENDENCY DETERMINATION AND INTEGRATIONDependencies may be characterized by the following attributes: mandatory or discretionary, internal or external(as described below). Dependency has four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the followingways: mandatory external dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, ordiscretionary internal dependencies. Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required orinherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations, such as on aconstruction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built,r on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependenciesare sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory.The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities.Mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool. Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic,preferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of bestpractices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequenceis desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted bestpractices recommend that during construction, the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbingwork. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performingthe activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fullydocumented since they can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling options. When fasttracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered forodification or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the processf sequencing the activities.191 External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and nonproject activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control. For example, thetesting activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, orgovernmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a constructionproject. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process ofsequencing the activities. Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities andare generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assembleit, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependenciesare internal during the process of sequencing the activities. | 3 LEADS AND LAGSA lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,n a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduledpunch list completion. This would be shown as a finishtostart with a 2week lead as shown in Figure 610. Lead is oftenrepresented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.192 A lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can beshown as a starttostart relationship with a 15day lag as shown in Figure 610. Lag can also be represented in projectschedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 611 in the relationship between activities H and / (as indicated by thenomenclature +10 (starttostart plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale).The project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately define thelogical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Also, duration estimates do not includeany leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions should be documented. | 4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems includes scheduling software that has thecapability to help plan, organize, and adjust the sequence of the activities; insert the logical relationships, lead and lagvalues; and differentiate the different types of dependencies.1936.3.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS | 1 PROJECT SCHEDULE NETWORK DIAGRAMSA project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to asdependencies, among the project schedule activities. Figure 611 illustrates a project schedule network diagram. Aproject schedule network diagram is produced manually or by using project management software. It can include fullproject details, or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describethe basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fullydescribed within the narrative.Activities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have multiple successoractivities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence are at greater risk as they are affectedby multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity PIPE is called a path convergence, as it has more than onepredecessor, while activity K is called a path divergence, as it has more than one successor. | 2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section  | 2. Activity attributes may describe a necessary sequence ofevents or defined predecessor or successor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationshipsbetween the activities. Activity list. Described in Section  | 1. The activity list may be impacted by the change in relationshipsamong the project activities during the sequencing activities. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log mayneed to be updated based on the sequencing, relationship determination, and leads and lags, and may give riseto individual project risks that may impact the project schedule. Milestone list. Described in Section  | 3. The scheduled dates for specific milestones may be impacted bychanges in relationships among the project activities during the sequencing activities.194 6.4 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONSEstimate Activity Durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individualactivities with estimated resources. The key benefit of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activitywill take to complete. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs ofthis process are depicted in Figure 612. Figure 613 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.195Estimating activity durations uses information from the scope of work, required resource types or skill levels,estimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may influence the duration estimates includeconstraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., fixed duration, fixed effort or work, fixednumber of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of durationriginate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the specificactivity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of theinput data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work,the accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.196 The Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to completethe activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity. These estimates are used toapproximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate projectand resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish anactivity, along with the skill proficiency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a drivingresource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple “straightline” orlinear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved,r number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation(e.g., a 24hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include: Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce aunit of work is increased while all other factors remain fixed, a point will eventually be reached at which additionsf that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output. Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources doesnot always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point addingtoo many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additionalcoordination, and other factors involved. Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, anincrease in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology,which may impact duration and resource needs. Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—or procrastination—when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Lawwhere work expands to fill the time available for its completion.All data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate.1976.4.1 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: INPUTS | 1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The schedule management plan defines the methodused, as well as the level of accuracy and other criteria required to estimate activity durations. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the WBS dictionary, which containstechnical details that can influence the effort and duration estimates. | 2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section  | 2. Activity attributes may describe defined predecessor orsuccessor relationships, as well as defined lead and lag and logical relationships between the activities that mayimpact duration estimates. Activity list. Described in Section  | 1. The activity list contains all schedule activities required on theproject, which are to be estimated. Dependencies and other constraints for these activities can influence theduration estimates. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Assumptions and constraints recorded in the assumption log maygive rise to individual project risks that may impact the project schedule. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard toeffort and duration estimating can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precisionf effort and duration estimates. Milestone list. Described in Section  | 3. The milestone list may have scheduled dates for specific milestonesthat may impact the duration estimates. Project team assignments. Described in Section 9.3.3.1. The project is staffed when the appropriate peoplehave been assigned to the team. Resource breakdown structure. Described in Section 9.2.3.3. The resource breakdown structure provides ahierarchical structure of the identified resources by resource category and resource type.198  Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. The resource calendars influence the duration of scheduleactivities due to the availability of specific resources, type of resources, and resources with specific attributes.Resource calendars specify when and how long identified project resources will be available during the project. Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. The estimated activity resource requirements will havean effect on the duration of the activity, since the level to which the resources assigned to the activity meetthe requirements will significantly influence the duration of most activities. For example, if additional or lowerskilled resources are assigned to an activity, there may be reduced efficiency or productivity due to increasedcommunication, training, and coordination needs leading to a longer duration estimate. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. Individual project risks may impact resource selection andavailability. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates, described in Section11.5.3.2, from Plan Risk Responses. | 3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are notlimited to: Duration estimating databases and other reference data, Productivity metrics, Published commercial information, and Location of team members. | 4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Activity Durations process include but are notlimited to: Historical duration information, Project calendars, Estimating policies, Scheduling methodology, and Lessons learned repository.1996.4.2 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics: Schedule development, management, and control; Expertise in estimating; and Discipline or application knowledge. | 2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATINGAnalogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historicaldata from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such asduration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a futureproject. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basisfor estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for knowndifferences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration whenthere is a limited amount of detailed information about the project.Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less timeconsuming than other techniques, but it is alsoless accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and maybe used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previousactivities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimateshave the needed expertise. | 3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATINGParametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration basedn historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical dataand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost,budget, and duration.200 Durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of laborhours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied bythe number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of laborhours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required toinstall 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built intothe model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunctionwith other estimating methods. | 4 THREEPOINT ESTIMATINGThe accuracy of singlepoint duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk.Using threepoint estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity’s duration: Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned,their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, andinterruptions. Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity. Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE,can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:tE (tO + iM + tP)/ 3.Triangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental data. Durationestimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range ofuncertainty around the expected duration.201 | 5 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATINGBottomup estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lowerlevel components of the WBS. When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence,the work wihin the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates arethen aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependenciesbetween theusage is ref that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resourcelected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity. | 6 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills;scheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated);and make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, andduration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work. Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserveneeded for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedulereserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedulebaseline, which is allocated for identified risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with theknownunknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingencyreserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a fixed number of work periods. Contingencyreserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about theproject becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should beclearly identified in the schedule documentation.Estimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Managementreserves are a specified amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and arereserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to addressthe unknownunknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline,but it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of managementreserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.202  | 7 DECISION MAKINGDescribed in Section 5.2.2.4. Decisionmaking techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limitedto voting. One variation of the voting method that is often used in agilebased projects is called the fist of five (also calledfist to five). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holdingup a closed fist (indicating no support) up to five fingers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer thanthree fingers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project managercontinues the fistoffive process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more fingers) or agreesto move on to the next decision. | 8 MEETINGSThe project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessaryto conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decidewhich of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to lowlevel tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacityver the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the first day of the iteration and is attended by the productwner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well asassumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions.6.4.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: OUTPUTS | 1 DURATION ESTIMATESDuration estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely number of time periods that are required to completean activity, a phase, or a project. Duration estimates do not include any lags as described in Section  | 3. Durationestimates may include some indication of the range of possible results. For example: A range of 2 weeks + 2 days, which indicates that the activity will take at least 8 days and not more than 12(assuming a 5day work week); or A 15% probability of exceeding 3 weeks, which indicates a high probability—85%—that the activity will take3 weeks or less.203 | 2 BASIS OF ESTIMATESThe amount and type of additional details supporting the duration estimate vary by application area. Regardless ofthe level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the durationestimate was derived.Supporting detail for duration estimates may include: Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed), Documentation of all assumptions made, Documentation of any known constraints, Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., +10%) to indicate that the duration is estimated between arange of values), Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate, and Documentation of individual project risks influencing this estimate. | 3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section  | 2. Activity duration estimates produced during this process aredocumented as part of the activity attributes. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. This includes assumptions made in developing the durationestimate, such as resource skill levels and availability, as well as a basis of estimates for durations. Additionally,constraints arising out of the scheduling methodology and scheduling tool are also documented. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated withtechniques that were efficient and effective in developing effort and duration estimates.204 6.5 DEVELOP SCHEDULEDevelop Schedule is the process of analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and scheduleconstraints to create a schedule model for project execution and monitoring and controlling. The key benefit of thisprocess is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities. This processis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted inFigure 614. Figure 615 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.205206 Developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The schedule model is used to determine theplanned start and finish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information. Scheduledevelopment can require the review and revision of duration estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves toestablish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress. Key steps include defining theproject milestones, identifying and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and finishdates have been determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assignedactivities. The staff confirms that the start and finish dates present no conflict with resource calendars or assignedactivities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed to determine conflicts withlogical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined. Revising andaintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project,as described in Section 6.7.For more specific information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling.6.5.1 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: INPUTS6.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1.

The amount and type of additional details supporting theduration estimate vary by application area. Regardless of the level of detail, the supporting documentation shouldprovide a clear and complete understanding of how the duration estimate was derived. Duration estimates. Described in Section  | 1. The duration estimates contain the quantitative assessmentsf the likely number of work periods that will be required to complete an activity. This will be used to calculatethe schedule. Lessons learned. Described in Section 4.4.3.1.

The risk register provides the details of all identified risks, and theircharacteristics, that affect the schedule model. Risk information relevant to the schedule is reflected in schedulereserves using the expected or mean risk impact.6.5.1.3 AGREEMENTSDescribed in Section 12.2.3.2. Vendors may have an input to the project schedule as they develop the details of howthey will perform the project work to meet contractual commitments.208 6.5.1.4 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Develop Schedule process include but are not limited to: Government or industry standards, and Communication channels.6.5.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Develop Schedule process include but are not limited to: Scheduling methodology containing the policies governing schedule model development and maintenance,and Project calendar(s).6.5.2 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES6.5.2.1 SCHEDULE NETWORK ANALYSISSchedule network analysis is the overarching technique used to generate the project schedule model. It employsseveral other techniques such as critical path method (described in Section 6.5.2.2), resource optimization techniques(described in Section 6.5.2.3), and modeling techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.4). Additional analysis includes butis not limited to: Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiplepaths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time, to reduce theprobability of a schedule slip. Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has highrisk activities or long lead items that would necessitateuse of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path.Schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed.2096.5.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHODThe critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of scheduleflexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. This schedule network analysis technique calculatesthe early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitationsby performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 616. In thisexample, the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and therefore the sequence of ACD is the critical path.The critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determinesthe shortest possible project duration. The longest path has the least total float—usually zero. The resulting earlyand late start and finish dates are not necessarily the project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods withinwhich the activity could be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logicalrelationships, leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path(s)and the amount of total and free float or schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.On any network path, the total float or schedule flexibility is measured by the amount of time that a scheduleactivity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date or violating aschedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total float on the critical path. As implementedwith the precedence diagramming method sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total floatdepending on the constraints applied. Positive total float is caused when the backward pass is calculated from aschedule constraint that is later than the early finish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation.Negative total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative floatanalysis is a technique that helps to find possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track.Schedule networks may have multiple nearcritical paths. Many software packages allow the user to define theparameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments to activity durations (when more resources or lessscope can be arranged), logical relationships (when the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads andlags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total float.Once the total float and the free float have been calculated, the free float is the amount of time that a scheduleactivity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. Forexample the free float for Activity B, in Figure 616, is 5 days.210 6.5.2.3 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATIONResource optimization is used to adjust the start and finish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to beequal to or less than resource availability. Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust theschedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to: Resource leveling. A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints withthe goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used whenshared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are overallocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (asshown in Figure 617), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can oftencause the original critical path to change. Available float is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the criticalpath through the project schedule may change. Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements forresources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed toresource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In otherwords, activities may only be delayed within their free and total float. Resource smoothing may not be able toptimize all resources.211212 6.5.2.4 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Whatif scenario analysis. Whatif scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predicttheir effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, “What if the situationrepresented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to computethe different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending specific engineering durations,r introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the whatifscenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and inpreparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations. Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertaintyto evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique isMonte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculatepossible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating multiple work package durationswith different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributionsand other representations of uncertainty (see Section 11.4.2.4). Figure 618 shows a probability distribution for aproject with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project finish date). In this example, there is a10% probability that the project will finish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probabilityf completing the project by May 28.213For more information on how Monte Carlo simulation is used for schedule models, see the Practice Standardfor Scheduling.6.5.2.5 LEADS AND LAGSDescribed in Section  | 3. Leads and lags are refinements applied during network analysis to develop a viableschedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. Leads are used in limited circumstances to advance asuccessor activity with respect to the predecessor activity, and lags are used in limited circumstances where processesrequire a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact.214 6.5.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREIONSchedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing theproject scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful techniqueis the negative float analysis. The critical path is the one with the least float. Due to violating a constraint or imposeddate, the total float can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 619 and include: Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite deliveryto activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resourceswill shorten the activity’s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result inincreased risk and/or cost. Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequenceare performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for abuilding before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increasedrisk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the criticalpath. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activitiesconcerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.2156.5.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that expeditesthe process of building a schedule model by generating start and finish dates based on the inputs of activities, networkdiagrams, resources, and activity durations.6.5.2.8 AGILE RELEASE PLANNINGAgile release planning provides a highlevel summary timeline of the release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months)based on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product’s evolution. Agile release planning alsodetermines the number of iterations or sprints in the release, and allows the product owner and team to decidehow much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals,dependencies, and impediments.Since features represent value to the customer, the timeline provides a more easily understood project scheduleas it defines which feature will be available at the end of each iteration, which is exactly the depth of information thecustomer is looking for.Figure 620 shows the relationship among product vision, product roadmap, release planning, and iteration planning.216 6.5.3 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS6.5.3.1 SCHEDULE BASELINEAschedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal changecontrol procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriatestakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline finish dates. During monitoring andcontrolling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and finish dates to determine if variances haveccurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan.6.5.3.2 PROJECT SCHEDULEThe project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations,ilestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned finish datefor each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resourceassignments have been confirmed and scheduled start and finish dates are established. This process usually occurs nolater than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may alsobe developed with a defined target start and target finish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented insummary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Althougha project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more ofthe following formats: Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listedn the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontalbars placed according to start and finish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used.Depending on the audience, float can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, thebroader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependentwork packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 621that is presented in a WBSstructured format.217 Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion ofajor deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 621. Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams are commonly presented in the activityonnodediagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a purelogic diagram, as shown in Figure 611, or presented in a timescaled schedule network diagram format thatis sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 621. These diagrams, withactivity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path scheduleactivities. This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities.Another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a timescaled logic diagram. These diagramsinclude a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They areptimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on thesame line of the diagram in sequence.Figure 621 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reportedthrough asof date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 621 reflects schedule presentations inthe forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailedschedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 621 also visually shows the relationships among thedifferent levels of detail of the project schedule.218 2196.5.3.3 SCHEDULE DATAThe schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information for describing and controlling theschedule. The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes,and documentation of all identified assumptions and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by applicationarea. Information frequently supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to: Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram; Alternative schedules, such as bestcase or worstcase, not resourceleveled or resourceleveled, or with orwithout imposed dates; and Applied schedule reserves.Schedule data could also include such items as resource histograms, cashflow projections, order and deliveryschedules, or other relevant information.6.5.3.4 PROJECT CALENDARSA project calendar identifies working days and shifts that are available for scheduled activities. It distinguishestime periods in days or parts of days that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are notavailable for work. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods forsome activities to calculate the project schedule. The project calendars may be updated.6.5.3.5 CHANGE REQUESTSDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Modifications to the project scope or project schedule may result in change requeststo the scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed forreview and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions mayinclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.220 6.5.3.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a changerequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The schedule management plan may be updated toreflect a change in the way the schedule was developed and will be managed. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response toapproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that arevised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.6.5.3.7 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section  | 2. Activity attributes are updated to include any revised resourcerequirements and any other revisions generated by the Develop Schedule process. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log may be updated with changes to assumptionsin duration, resource utilization, sequencing, or other information that is revealed as a result of developing theschedule model. Duration estimates. Described in Section  | 1. The number and availability of resources, along with theactivity dependencies can result in a change to the duration estimates. If the resourceleveling analysis changesthe resource requirements, then the duration estimates will likely need to be updated as well. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated withtechniques that were efficient and effective in developing the schedule model. Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource leveling can have a significant effect onpreliminary estimates for the types and quantities of resources required. If the resourceleveling analysis changesthe resource requirements, then the resource requirements are updated. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may need to be updated to reflect opportunities orthreats perceived through scheduling assumptions.2216.6 CONTROL SCHEDULEControl Schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managingchanges to the schedule baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughoutthe project. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of thisprocess are depicted in Figure 622. Figure 623 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.222 Updating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. Any change to the schedule baselinecan only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Control Schedule, as acomponent of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, is concerned with: Determining the current status of the project schedule, Influencing the factors that create schedule changes, Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves, Determining if the project schedule has changed, and Managing the actual changes as they occur.223When an agile approach is used, Control Schedule is concerned with: Determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered andaccepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle; Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting processes and improving,if required; Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog); Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted (velocity) in the given timeper iteration (agreedupon work cycle duration, typically 2 weeks or 1 month); Determining that the project schedule has changed; and Managing the actual changes as they occur.When work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means ofensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control. Scheduled status reviews andwalkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete.6.6.1 CONTROL SCHEDULE: INPUTS6.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The schedule management describes the frequencythat the schedule will be updated, how reserve will be used, and how the schedule will be controlled. Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline is compared with actual results todetermine if a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptionsdocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly when monitoring and controlling the schedulebaseline. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis theperformance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, orpreventive action is necessary.224 6.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied tolater phases in the project to improve schedule control. Project calendars. Described in Section 6.5.3.4. A schedule model may require more than one project calendarto allow for different work periods for some activities to calculate the schedule forecasts. Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Project schedule refers to the most recent version with notationsto indicate updates, completed activities, and started activities as of the indicated date. Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars show the availability of team andphysical resources. Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. Schedule data will be reviewed and updated in the ControlSchedule process.6.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE DATADescribed in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which activities havestarted, their progress (e.g., actual duration, remaining duration, and physical percent complete), and which activitieshave finished.6.6.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Control Schedule process include but are not limited to: Existing formal and informal schedule controlrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines; Schedule control tools; and Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.2256.6.2 CONTROL SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES6.6.2.1 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule performance measurements such as schedulevariance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the originalschedule baseline. Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. Itis used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iterationplanning (see Section  | 8). A forecast trend line can be used to predict the likely variance at iterationcompletion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the idealburndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completionbased on remaining work. Figure 624 is an example of an iteration burndown chart.226  Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze schedule performance againstthe schedule baseline such as actual start and finish dates, percent complete, and remaining duration for workin progress. Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determinewhether performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understandingperformance to date and for comparing to future performance goals in the form of completion dates. Variance analysis. Variance analysis looks at variances in planned versus actual start and finish dates, plannedversus actual durations, and variances in float. Part of variance analysis is determining the cause and degree ofvariance relative to the schedule baseline (see Section 6.5.3.1), estimating the implications of those variancesfor future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. For example, aajor delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on the overall project schedule, while auch shorter delay on a critical or nearcritical activity may require immediate action. Whatif scenario analysis. Described in Section 6.5.2.4. Whatif scenario analysis is used to assess the variousscenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model intoalignment with the project management plan and approved baseline.6.6.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHODDescribed in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. Thevariance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date. Evaluating the progress of activities onnear critical paths can identify schedule risk.6.6.2.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that providesthe ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, to report variances to and progress made against the schedulebaseline, and to forecast the effects of changes to the project schedule model.6.6.2.4 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATIONDescribed in Section 6.5.2.3. Resource optimization techniques involve the scheduling of activities and the resourcesrequired by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.2276.6.2.5 LEADS AND LAGSAdjusting leads and lags is applied during network analysis to find ways to bring project activities that are behind intoalignment with the plan. For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping can be adjusted tostart before the exterior work of the building is completed by increasing the lead time in the relationship, or a technicalwriting team can adjust the start of editing the draft of a large document immediately after the document is written byeliminating or decreasing lag time.6.6.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREIONSchedule compression techniques (see Section 6.5.2.6) are used to find ways to bring project activities that arebehind into alignment with the plan by fast tracking or crashing the schedule for the remaining work.6.6.3 CONTROL SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS6.6.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATIONDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project workis performing compared to the schedule baseline. Variances in the start and finish dates and the durations can becalculated at the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, the (SV) and(SPI) are documented for inclusion in work performance reports (see Section 4.5.3.1).6.6.3.2 SCHEDULE FORECASTSSchedule updates are forecasts of estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the projects future based oninformation and knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are updated and reissued based on workperformance information provided as the project is executed. The information is based on the projects past performanceand expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions. This can include earned value performanceindicators, as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.228 6.6.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTSDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Schedule variance analysis, as well as reviews of progress reports, results of performanceeasures, and modifications to the project scope or project schedule, may result in change requests to the schedulebaseline, scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processedfor review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions mayinclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.6.6.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a changerequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The schedule management plan may be updated toreflect a change in the way the schedule is managed. Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated inresponse to approved change requests related to change in project scope, resources, or activity durationestimates. The schedule baseline may be updated to reflect changes caused by schedule compressiontechniques or performance issues. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response toapproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurementbaseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.In some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise theperformance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.2296.6.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to reviseassumptions on activity sequencing, durations, and productivity. Basis of estimates. Described in Section  | 2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise theway duration estimates were developed. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated withtechniques that were effective in maintaining the schedule, causes of variances, and corrective actions that wereused to respond to schedule variances. Project schedule. An updated project schedule (see Section 6.5.3.2) will be generated from the schedule modelpopulated with updated schedule data to reflect the schedule changes and manage the project. Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars are updated to reflect changes tothe utilization of resource calendars that were the result of optimizing resources, schedule compression, andcorrective or preventive actions. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register and risk response plans within it, may be updatedbased on the risks that may arise due to schedule compression techniques. Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. New project schedule network diagrams may be developed todisplay approved remaining durations and approved modifications to the schedule. In some cases, projectschedule delays can be so severe that a new target schedule with forecasted start and finish dates is needed toprovide realistic data for directing the work, measuring performance, and measuring progress.230 '"

       " ' 1 SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLANThe schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteriaand the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management plan may beformal or informal, highly detailed, or broadly framed based on the needs of the project, and includes appropriatecontrol thresholds.181The schedule management plan can establish the following:Project schedule model development. The scheduling methodology and the scheduling tool to be used in thedevelopment of the project schedule model are specified.Release and iteration length. When using an adaptive life cycle, the timeboxed periods for releases, waves,and iterations are specified. Timeboxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily towardcompletion of a goal. Timeboxing helps to minimize scope creep as it forces the teams to process essentialfeatures first, then other features when time permits.Level of accuracy. The level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining realistic activityduration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies.Units of measure. Each unit of measurement (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures, oreters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures) is defined for each of the resources.Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the frameworkfor the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates and resulting schedules.Project schedule model maintenance. The process used to update the status and record progress of theproject in the schedule model during the execution of the project is defined.Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be specified to indicate anagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typicallyexpressed as percentage deviations from the parameters established in the baseline plan.Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules or other physical measurementrules of performance measurement are set. For example, the schedule management plan may specify: Rules for establishing percent complete, EVM techniques (e.g., baselines, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to be employed (for more specificinformation, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value Management [17]), and Schedule performance measurements such as schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI)used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original schedule baseline.Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined.1826.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIESDefine Activities is the process of identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to producethe project deliverables. The key benefit of this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activitiesthat provide a basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, monitoring, and controlling the project work.

The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of thisprocess are depicted in Figure 67. Figure 68 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.187Every activity except the first and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successoractivity with an appropriate logical relationship. Logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic projectschedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable projectschedule. Sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automatedtechniques.

       " ' 1 PRECEDENCE DIAGRAMMING METHODThe precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activitiesare represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in whichthe activities are to be performed.PDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that logicallycomes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes afteranother activity in a schedule. These relationships are defined below and are illustrated in Figure 69:189 Finishtostart (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activityhas finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardwareis assembled (predecessor). Finishtofinish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activityhas finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to finish before editing the document(successor) can finish. Starttostart (). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activityhas started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins. Starttofinish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activityhas started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) has to start before the old accountspayable system can be shut down (predecessor).In PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, butis included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.Two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example,  and FF). Multiple relationshipsbetween the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with thehighest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.190  ',\n",
       " ' 2 DEPENDENCY DETERMINATION AND INTEGRATIONDependencies may be characterized by the following attributes: mandatory or discretionary, internal or external(as described below). Dependency has four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the followingways: mandatory external dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, ordiscretionary internal dependencies. Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required orinherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations, such as on aconstruction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built,r on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependenciesare sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory.The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities.Mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool. Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic,preferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of bestpractices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequenceis desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted bestpractices recommend that during construction, the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbingwork. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performingthe activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fullydocumented since they can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling options. When fasttracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered forodification or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the processf sequencing the activities.191 External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and nonproject activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control. For example, thetesting activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, orgovernmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a constructionproject. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process ofsequencing the activities. Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities andare generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assembleit, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependenciesare internal during the process of sequencing the activities. ',\n",
       " ' 3 LEADS AND LAGSA lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,n a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduledpunch list completion. This would be shown as a finishtostart with a 2week lead as shown in Figure 610. Lead is oftenrepresented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.192 A lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can beshown as a starttostart relationship with a 15day lag as shown in Figure 610. Lag can also be represented in projectschedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 611 in the relationship between activities H and / (as indicated by thenomenclature +10 (starttostart plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale).The project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately define thelogical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Also, duration estimates do not includeany leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions should be documented. ',\n",
       " ' 4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems includes scheduling software that has thecapability to help plan, organize, and adjust the sequence of the activities; insert the logical relationships, lead and lagvalues; and differentiate the different types of dependencies.1936.3.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: OUTPUTS ',\n",
       " ' 1 PROJECT SCHEDULE NETWORK DIAGRAMSA project schedule network diagram is a graphical representation of the logical relationships, also referred to asdependencies, among the project schedule activities. Figure 611 illustrates a project schedule network diagram. Aproject schedule network diagram is produced manually or by using project management software. It can include fullproject details, or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describethe basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fullydescribed within the narrative.Activities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have multiple successoractivities indicate a path divergence.

The key benefit of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activitywill take to complete. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs ofthis process are depicted in Figure 612. Figure 613 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.195Estimating activity durations uses information from the scope of work, required resource types or skill levels,estimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may influence the duration estimates includeconstraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., fixed duration, fixed effort or work, fixednumber of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of durationriginate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the specificactivity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of theinput data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work,the accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.196 The Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to completethe activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity. These estimates are used toapproximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate projectand resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish anactivity, along with the skill proficiency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a drivingresource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple “straightline” orlinear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved,r number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation(e.g., a 24hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include: Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce aunit of work is increased while all other factors remain fixed, a point will eventually be reached at which additionsf that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output. Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources doesnot always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point addingtoo many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additionalcoordination, and other factors involved. Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, anincrease in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology,which may impact duration and resource needs. Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—or procrastination—when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Lawwhere work expands to fill the time available for its completion.All data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate.1976.4.1 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: INPUTS ',\n",

       " ' 2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATINGAnalogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historicaldata from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such asduration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a futureproject. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basisfor estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for knowndifferences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration whenthere is a limited amount of detailed information about the project.Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less timeconsuming than other techniques, but it is alsoless accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and maybe used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previousactivities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimateshave the needed expertise. ',\n",
       " ' 3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATINGParametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration basedn historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical dataand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost,budget, and duration.200 Durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of laborhours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied bythe number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of laborhours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required toinstall 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built intothe model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunctionwith other estimating methods. ',\n",
       " ' 4 THREEPOINT ESTIMATINGThe accuracy of singlepoint duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk.Using threepoint estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity’s duration: Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned,their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, andinterruptions. Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity. Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE,can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:tE (tO + iM + tP)/ 3.Triangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental data. Durationestimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range ofuncertainty around the expected duration.201 ',\n",
       " ' 5 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATINGBottomup estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lowerlevel components of the WBS. When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence,the work wihin the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates arethen aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependenciesbetween theusage is ref that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resourcelected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity. ',\n",
       " ' 6 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills;scheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated);and make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, andduration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work. Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserveneeded for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedulereserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedulebaseline, which is allocated for identified risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with theknownunknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingencyreserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a fixed number of work periods. Contingencyreserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about theproject becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should beclearly identified in the schedule documentation.Estimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Managementreserves are a specified amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and arereserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to addressthe unknownunknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline,but it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of managementreserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.202  ',\n",
       " ' 7 DECISION MAKINGDescribed in Section 5.2.2.4. Decisionmaking techniques that can be used in this process include but are not limitedto voting. One variation of the voting method that is often used in agilebased projects is called the fist of five (also calledfist to five). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holdingup a closed fist (indicating no support) up to five fingers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer thanthree fingers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project managercontinues the fistoffive process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more fingers) or agreesto move on to the next decision. ',\n",
       " ' 8 MEETINGSThe project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessaryto conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decidewhich of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to lowlevel tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacityver the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the first day of the iteration and is attended by the productwner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well asassumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions.6.4.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: OUTPUTS ',\n",

The key benefit of thisprocess is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities. This processis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted inFigure 614. Figure 615 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.205206 Developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The schedule model is used to determine theplanned start and finish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information. Scheduledevelopment can require the review and revision of duration estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves toestablish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress. Key steps include defining theproject milestones, identifying and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and finishdates have been determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assignedactivities. The staff confirms that the start and finish dates present no conflict with resource calendars or assignedactivities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed to determine conflicts withlogical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined. Revising andaintaining the project schedule model to sustain a realistic schedule continues throughout the duration of the project,as described in Section 6.7.For more specific information regarding scheduling, refer to the Practice Standard for Scheduling.6.5.1 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: INPUTS6.5.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1.

It employsseveral other techniques such as critical path method (described in Section 6.5.2.2), resource optimization techniques(described in Section 6.5.2.3), and modeling techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.4). Additional analysis includes butis not limited to: Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiplepaths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time, to reduce theprobability of a schedule slip. Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has highrisk activities or long lead items that would necessitateuse of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path.Schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed.2096.5.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHODThe critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of scheduleflexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. This schedule network analysis technique calculatesthe early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitationsby performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 616. In thisexample, the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and therefore the sequence of ACD is the critical path.The critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determinesthe shortest possible project duration. The longest path has the least total float—usually zero. The resulting earlyand late start and finish dates are not necessarily the project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods withinwhich the activity could be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logicalrelationships, leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path(s)and the amount of total and free float or schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.On any network path, the total float or schedule flexibility is measured by the amount of time that a scheduleactivity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date or violating aschedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total float on the critical path. As implementedwith the precedence diagramming method sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total floatdepending on the constraints applied. Positive total float is caused when the backward pass is calculated from aschedule constraint that is later than the early finish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation.Negative total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative floatanalysis is a technique that helps to find possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track.Schedule networks may have multiple nearcritical paths. Many software packages allow the user to define theparameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments to activity durations (when more resources or lessscope can be arranged), logical relationships (when the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads andlags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total float.Once the total float and the free float have been calculated, the free float is the amount of time that a scheduleactivity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. Forexample the free float for Activity B, in Figure 616, is 5 days.210 6.5.2.3 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATIONResource optimization is used to adjust the start and finish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to beequal to or less than resource availability. Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust theschedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to: Resource leveling. A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints withthe goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used whenshared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are overallocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (asshown in Figure 617), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can oftencause the original critical path to change. Available float is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the criticalpath through the project schedule may change. Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements forresources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed toresource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In otherwords, activities may only be delayed within their free and total float. Resource smoothing may not be able toptimize all resources.211212 6.5.2.4 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Whatif scenario analysis. Whatif scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predicttheir effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, “What if the situationrepresented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to computethe different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending specific engineering durations,r introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the whatifscenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and inpreparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations. Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertaintyto evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique isMonte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculatepossible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating multiple work package durationswith different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributionsand other representations of uncertainty (see Section 11.4.2.4). Figure 618 shows a probability distribution for aproject with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project finish date). In this example, there is a10% probability that the project will finish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probabilityf completing the project by May 28.213For more information on how Monte Carlo simulation is used for schedule models, see the Practice Standardfor Scheduling.6.5.2.5 LEADS AND LAGSDescribed in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 3. Leads and lags are refinements applied during network analysis to develop a viableschedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. Leads are used in limited circumstances to advance asuccessor activity with respect to the predecessor activity, and lags are used in limited circumstances where processesrequire a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact.214 6.5.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREIONSchedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing theproject scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful techniqueis the negative float analysis. The critical path is the one with the least float. Due to violating a constraint or imposeddate, the total float can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 619 and include: Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite deliveryto activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resourceswill shorten the activity’s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result inincreased risk and/or cost. Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequenceare performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for abuilding before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increasedrisk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the criticalpath. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activitiesconcerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.2156.5.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that expeditesthe process of building a schedule model by generating start and finish dates based on the inputs of activities, networkdiagrams, resources, and activity durations.6.5.2.8 AGILE RELEASE PLANNINGAgile release planning provides a highlevel summary timeline of the release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months)based on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product’s evolution. Agile release planning alsodetermines the number of iterations or sprints in the release, and allows the product owner and team to decidehow much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals,dependencies, and impediments.Since features represent value to the customer, the timeline provides a more easily understood project scheduleas it defines which feature will be available at the end of each iteration, which is exactly the depth of information thecustomer is looking for.Figure 620 shows the relationship among product vision, product roadmap, release planning, and iteration planning.216 6.5.3 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS6.5.3.1 SCHEDULE BASELINEAschedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal changecontrol procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriatestakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline finish dates. During monitoring andcontrolling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and finish dates to determine if variances haveccurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan.6.5.3.2 PROJECT SCHEDULEThe project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations,ilestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned finish datefor each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resourceassignments have been confirmed and scheduled start and finish dates are established. This process usually occurs nolater than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may alsobe developed with a defined target start and target finish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented insummary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Althougha project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more ofthe following formats: Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listedn the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontalbars placed according to start and finish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used.Depending on the audience, float can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, thebroader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependentwork packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 621that is presented in a WBSstructured format.217 Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion ofajor deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 621. Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams are commonly presented in the activityonnodediagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a purelogic diagram, as shown in Figure 611, or presented in a timescaled schedule network diagram format thatis sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 621. These diagrams, withactivity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path scheduleactivities. This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities.Another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a timescaled logic diagram. These diagramsinclude a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They areptimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on thesame line of the diagram in sequence.Figure 621 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reportedthrough asof date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 621 reflects schedule presentations inthe forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailedschedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 621 also visually shows the relationships among thedifferent levels of detail of the project schedule.218 2196.5.3.3 SCHEDULE DATAThe schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information for describing and controlling theschedule. The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes,and documentation of all identified assumptions and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by applicationarea. Information frequently supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to: Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram; Alternative schedules, such as bestcase or worstcase, not resourceleveled or resourceleveled, or with orwithout imposed dates; and Applied schedule reserves.Schedule data could also include such items as resource histograms, cashflow projections, order and deliveryschedules, or other relevant information.6.5.3.4 PROJECT CALENDARSA project calendar identifies working days and shifts that are available for scheduled activities. It distinguishestime periods in days or parts of days that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are notavailable for work. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods forsome activities to calculate the project schedule. The project calendars may be updated.6.5.3.5 CHANGE REQUESTSDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Modifications to the project scope or project schedule may result in change requeststo the scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed forreview and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions mayinclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.220 6.5.3.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a changerequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 1. The schedule management plan may be updated toreflect a change in the way the schedule was developed and will be managed. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response toapproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that arevised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.6.5.3.7 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 2. Activity attributes are updated to include any revised resourcerequirements and any other revisions generated by the Develop Schedule process. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log may be updated with changes to assumptionsin duration, resource utilization, sequencing, or other information that is revealed as a result of developing theschedule model. Duration estimates. Described in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 1. The number and availability of resources, along with theactivity dependencies can result in a change to the duration estimates. If the resourceleveling analysis changesthe resource requirements, then the duration estimates will likely need to be updated as well. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated withtechniques that were efficient and effective in developing the schedule model. Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource leveling can have a significant effect onpreliminary estimates for the types and quantities of resources required. If the resourceleveling analysis changesthe resource requirements, then the resource requirements are updated. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may need to be updated to reflect opportunities orthreats perceived through scheduling assumptions.2216.6 CONTROL SCHEDULEControl Schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managingchanges to the schedule baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughoutthe project. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of thisprocess are depicted in Figure 622. Figure 623 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.222 Updating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. Any change to the schedule baselinecan only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Control Schedule, as acomponent of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, is concerned with: Determining the current status of the project schedule, Influencing the factors that create schedule changes, Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves, Determining if the project schedule has changed, and Managing the actual changes as they occur.223When an agile approach is used, Control Schedule is concerned with: Determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered andaccepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle; Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting processes and improving,if required; Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog); Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted (velocity) in the given timeper iteration (agreedupon work cycle duration, typically 2 weeks or 1 month); Determining that the project schedule has changed; and Managing the actual changes as they occur.When work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means ofensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control. Scheduled status reviews andwalkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete.6.6.1 CONTROL SCHEDULE: INPUTS6.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 1. The schedule management describes the frequencythat the schedule will be updated, how reserve will be used, and how the schedule will be controlled. Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline is compared with actual results todetermine if a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptionsdocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly when monitoring and controlling the schedulebaseline. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis theperformance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, orpreventive action is necessary.224 6.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied tolater phases in the project to improve schedule control. Project calendars. Described in Section 6.5.3.4. A schedule model may require more than one project calendarto allow for different work periods for some activities to calculate the schedule forecasts. Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Project schedule refers to the most recent version with notationsto indicate updates, completed activities, and started activities as of the indicated date. Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars show the availability of team andphysical resources. Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. Schedule data will be reviewed and updated in the ControlSchedule process.6.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE DATADescribed in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which activities havestarted, their progress (e.g., actual duration, remaining duration, and physical percent complete), and which activitieshave finished.6.6.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Control Schedule process include but are not limited to: Existing formal and informal schedule controlrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines; Schedule control tools; and Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.2256.6.2 CONTROL SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES6.6.2.1 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule performance measurements such as schedulevariance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the originalschedule baseline. Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. Itis used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iterationplanning (see Section  ',\n",
       " ' 8). A forecast trend line can be used to predict the likely variance at iterationcompletion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the idealburndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completionbased on remaining work. Figure 624 is an example of an iteration burndown chart.226  Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze schedule performance againstthe schedule baseline such as actual start and finish dates, percent complete, and remaining duration for workin progress. Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determinewhether performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understandingperformance to date and for comparing to future performance goals in the form of completion dates. Variance analysis. Variance analysis looks at variances in planned versus actual start and finish dates, plannedversus actual durations, and variances in float. Part of variance analysis is determining the cause and degree ofvariance relative to the schedule baseline (see Section 6.5.3.1), estimating the implications of those variancesfor future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. For example, aajor delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on the overall project schedule, while auch shorter delay on a critical or nearcritical activity may require immediate action. Whatif scenario analysis. Described in Section 6.5.2.4. Whatif scenario analysis is used to assess the variousscenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model intoalignment with the project management plan and approved baseline.6.6.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHODDescribed in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. Thevariance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date. Evaluating the progress of activities onnear critical paths can identify schedule risk.6.6.2.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that providesthe ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, to report variances to and progress made against the schedulebaseline, and to forecast the effects of changes to the project schedule model.6.6.2.4 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATIONDescribed in Section 6.5.2.3. Resource optimization techniques involve the scheduling of activities and the resourcesrequired by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.2276.6.2.5 LEADS AND LAGSAdjusting leads and lags is applied during network analysis to find ways to bring project activities that are behind intoalignment with the plan. For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping can be adjusted tostart before the exterior work of the building is completed by increasing the lead time in the relationship, or a technicalwriting team can adjust the start of editing the draft of a large document immediately after the document is written byeliminating or decreasing lag time.6.6.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREIONSchedule compression techniques (see Section 6.5.2.6) are used to find ways to bring project activities that arebehind into alignment with the plan by fast tracking or crashing the schedule for the remaining work.6.6.3 CONTROL SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS6.6.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATIONDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project workis performing compared to the schedule baseline. Variances in the start and finish dates and the durations can becalculated at the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, the (SV) and(SPI) are documented for inclusion in work performance reports (see Section 4.5.3.1).6.6.3.2 SCHEDULE FORECASTSSchedule updates are forecasts of estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the projects future based oninformation and knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are updated and reissued based on workperformance information provided as the project is executed. The information is based on the projects past performanceand expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions. This can include earned value performanceindicators, as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.228 6.6.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTSDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Schedule variance analysis, as well as reviews of progress reports, results of performanceeasures, and modifications to the project scope or project schedule, may result in change requests to the schedulebaseline, scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processedfor review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions mayinclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.6.6.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a changerequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 1. The schedule management plan may be updated toreflect a change in the way the schedule is managed. Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Changes to the schedule baseline are incorporated inresponse to approved change requests related to change in project scope, resources, or activity durationestimates. The schedule baseline may be updated to reflect changes caused by schedule compressiontechniques or performance issues. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response toapproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurementbaseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.In some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise theperformance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.2296.6.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to reviseassumptions on activity sequencing, durations, and productivity. Basis of estimates. Described in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 2. Schedule performance may indicate the need to revise theway duration estimates were developed. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated withtechniques that were effective in maintaining the schedule, causes of variances, and corrective actions that wereused to respond to schedule variances. Project schedule. An updated project schedule (see Section 6.5.3.2) will be generated from the schedule modelpopulated with updated schedule data to reflect the schedule changes and manage the project. Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars are updated to reflect changes tothe utilization of resource calendars that were the result of optimizing resources, schedule compression, andcorrective or preventive actions. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register and risk response plans within it, may be updatedbased on the risks that may arise due to schedule compression techniques. Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. New project schedule network diagrams may be developed todisplay approved remaining durations and approved modifications to the schedule. In some cases, projectschedule delays can be so severe that a new target schedule with forecasted start and finish dates is needed toprovide realistic data for directing the work, measuring performance, and measuring progress.230 ']"

       " ' 1 SCHEDULE MANAGEMENT PLANThe schedule management plan is a component of the project management plan that establishes the criteriaand the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management plan may beformal or informal, highly detailed, or broadly framed based on the needs of the project, and includes appropriatecontrol thresholds.181The schedule management plan can establish the following:Project schedule model development. The scheduling methodology and the scheduling tool to be used in thedevelopment of the project schedule model are specified.Release and iteration length. When using an adaptive life cycle, the timeboxed periods for releases, waves,and iterations are specified. Timeboxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily towardcompletion of a goal. Timeboxing helps to minimize scope creep as it forces the teams to process essentialfeatures first, then other features when time permits.Level of accuracy. The level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining realistic activityduration estimates and may include an amount for contingencies.Units of measure. Each unit of measurement (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures, oreters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures) is defined for each of the resources.Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the frameworkfor the schedule management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates and resulting schedules.Project schedule model maintenance. The process used to update the status and record progress of theproject in the schedule model during the execution of the project is defined.Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring schedule performance may be specified to indicate anagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typicallyexpressed as percentage deviations from the parameters established in the baseline plan.Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules or other physical measurementrules of performance measurement are set. For example, the schedule management plan may specify: Rules for establishing percent complete, EVM techniques (e.g., baselines, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to be employed (for more specificinformation, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value Management [17]), and Schedule performance measurements such as schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI)used to assess the magnitude of variation to the original schedule baseline.Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various schedule reports are defined.1826.2 DEFINE ACTIVITIESDefine Activities is the process of identifying and documenting the specific actions to be performed to producethe project deliverables. The key benefit of this process is that it decomposes work packages into schedule activitiesthat provide a basis for estimating, scheduling, executing, monitoring, and controlling the project work. This processis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted inFigure 65. Figure 66 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.1836.2.1 DEFINE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS ',\n",

Activities represent the effort needed to complete a workpackage. The Define Activities process defines the final outputs as activities rather than deliverables, as done in theCreate WBS process (Section 5.4).The activity list, WBS, and WBS dictionary can be developed either sequentially or concurrently, with the WBS and WBSdictionary used as the basis for development of the final activity list. Each work package within the WBS is decomposedinto the activities required to produce the work package deliverables. Involving team members in the decomposition canlead to better and more accurate results. ',\n",
       " ' 3 ROLLING WAVE PLANNINGRolling wave planning is an iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term isplanned in detail, while work further in the future is planned at a higher level. It is a form of progressive elaborationapplicable to work packages, planning packages, and release planning when using an agile or waterfall approach.Therefore, work can exist at various levels of detail depending on where it is in the project life cycle. During earlystrategic planning when information is less defined, work packages may be decomposed to the known level of detail. Asore is known about the upcoming events in the near term, work packages can be decomposed into activities. ',\n",

Throughout the project, work packages are progressivelyelaborated into activities. This process may reveal work that was not part of the initial schedule baseline,necessitating a change to delivery dates or other significant schedule milestones that are part of theschedule baseline. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response toapproved changes in schedule activities.186 6.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIESSequence Activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities. The keybenefit of this process is that it defines the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efficiency given all projectconstraints. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of thisprocess are depicted in Figure 67. Figure 68 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.187Every activity except the first and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successoractivity with an appropriate logical relationship. Logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic projectschedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable projectschedule. Sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automatedtechniques. The Sequence Activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram toact as a first step to publish the schedule baseline.6.3.1 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS ',\n",

       " ' 1 PRECEDENCE DIAGRAMMING METHODThe precedence diagramming method (PDM) is a technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activitiesare represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence in whichthe activities are to be performed.PDM includes four types of dependencies or logical relationships. A predecessor activity is an activity that logicallycomes before a dependent activity in a schedule. A successor activity is a dependent activity that logically comes afteranother activity in a schedule. These relationships are defined below and are illustrated in Figure 69:189 Finishtostart (FS). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activityhas finished. For example, installing the operating system on a PC (successor) cannot start until the PC hardwareis assembled (predecessor). Finishtofinish (FF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activityhas finished. For example, writing a document (predecessor) is required to finish before editing the document(successor) can finish. Starttostart (). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activityhas started. For example, level concrete (successor) cannot begin until pour foundation (predecessor) begins. Starttofinish (SF). A logical relationship in which a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activityhas started. For example, a new accounts payable system (successor) has to start before the old accountspayable system can be shut down (predecessor).In PDM, FS is the most commonly used type of precedence relationship. The SF relationship is very rarely used, butis included to present a complete list of the PDM relationship types.Two activities can have two logical relationships at the same time (for example,  and FF). Multiple relationshipsbetween the same activities are not recommended, so a decision has to be made to select the relationship with thehighest impact. Closed loops are also not recommended in logical relationships.190  ',\n",
       " ' 2 DEPENDENCY DETERMINATION AND INTEGRATIONDependencies may be characterized by the following attributes: mandatory or discretionary, internal or external(as described below). Dependency has four attributes, but two can be applicable at the same time in the followingways: mandatory external dependencies, mandatory internal dependencies, discretionary external dependencies, ordiscretionary internal dependencies. Mandatory dependencies. Mandatory dependencies are those that are legally or contractually required orinherent in the nature of the work. Mandatory dependencies often involve physical limitations, such as on aconstruction project, where it is impossible to erect the superstructure until after the foundation has been built,r on an electronics project, where a prototype has to be built before it can be tested. Mandatory dependenciesare sometimes referred to as hard logic or hard dependencies. Technical dependencies may not be mandatory.The project team determines which dependencies are mandatory during the process of sequencing the activities.Mandatory dependencies should not be confused with assigning schedule constraints in the scheduling tool. Discretionary dependencies. Discretionary dependencies are sometimes referred to as preferred logic,preferential logic, or soft logic. Discretionary dependencies are established based on knowledge of bestpractices within a particular application area or some unusual aspect of the project where a specific sequenceis desired, even though there may be other acceptable sequences. For example, generally accepted bestpractices recommend that during construction, the electrical work should start after finishing the plumbingwork. This order is not mandatory and both activities may occur at the same time (in parallel), but performingthe activities in sequential order reduces the overall project risk. Discretionary dependencies should be fullydocumented since they can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling options. When fasttracking techniques are employed, these discretionary dependencies should be reviewed and considered forodification or removal. The project team determines which dependencies are discretionary during the processf sequencing the activities.191 External dependencies. External dependencies involve a relationship between project activities and nonproject activities. These dependencies are usually outside of the project team’s control. For example, thetesting activity in a software project may be dependent on the delivery of hardware from an external source, orgovernmental environmental hearings may need to be held before site preparation can begin on a constructionproject. The project management team determines which dependencies are external during the process ofsequencing the activities. Internal dependencies. Internal dependencies involve a precedence relationship between project activities andare generally inside the project team’s control. For example, if the team cannot test a machine until they assembleit, there is an internal mandatory dependency. The project management team determines which dependenciesare internal during the process of sequencing the activities. ',\n",
       " ' 3 LEADS AND LAGSA lead is the amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,n a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start 2 weeks prior to the scheduledpunch list completion. This would be shown as a finishtostart with a 2week lead as shown in Figure 610. Lead is oftenrepresented as a negative value for lag in scheduling software.192 A lag is the amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. For example,a technical writing team may begin editing the draft of a large document 15 days after they begin writing it. This can beshown as a starttostart relationship with a 15day lag as shown in Figure 610. Lag can also be represented in projectschedule network diagrams as shown in Figure 611 in the relationship between activities H and / (as indicated by thenomenclature +10 (starttostart plus 10 days lag) even though the offset is not shown relative to a timescale).The project management team determines the dependencies that may require a lead or a lag to accurately define thelogical relationship. The use of leads and lags should not replace schedule logic. Also, duration estimates do not includeany leads or lags. Activities and their related assumptions should be documented. ',\n",

It can include fullproject details, or have one or more summary activities. A summary narrative can accompany the diagram and describethe basic approach used to sequence the activities. Any unusual activity sequences within the network should be fullydescribed within the narrative.Activities that have multiple predecessor activities indicate a path convergence. Activities that have multiple successoractivities indicate a path divergence. Activities with divergence and convergence are at greater risk as they are affectedby multiple activities or can affect multiple activities. Activity PIPE is called a path convergence, as it has more than onepredecessor, while activity K is called a path divergence, as it has more than one successor. ',\n",

The scheduled dates for specific milestones may be impacted bychanges in relationships among the project activities during the sequencing activities.194 6.4 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONSEstimate Activity Durations is the process of estimating the number of work periods needed to complete individualactivities with estimated resources. The key benefit of this process is that it provides the amount of time each activitywill take to complete. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs ofthis process are depicted in Figure 612. Figure 613 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.195Estimating activity durations uses information from the scope of work, required resource types or skill levels,estimated resource quantities, and resource calendars. Other factors that may influence the duration estimates includeconstraints imposed on the duration, effort involved, or type of resources (e.g., fixed duration, fixed effort or work, fixednumber of resources), as well as the schedule network analysis technique used. The inputs for the estimates of durationriginate from the person or group on the project team who is most familiar with the nature of the work in the specificactivity. The duration estimate is progressively elaborated, and the process considers the quality and availability of theinput data. For example, as more detailed and precise data are available about the project engineering and design work,the accuracy and quality of the duration estimates improve.196 The Estimate Activity Durations process requires an estimation of the amount of work effort required to completethe activity and the amount of available resources estimated to complete the activity. These estimates are used toapproximate the number of work periods (activity duration) needed to complete the activity using the appropriate projectand resource calendars. In many cases, the number of resources that are expected to be available to accomplish anactivity, along with the skill proficiency of those resources, may determine the activity’s duration. A change to a drivingresource allocated to the activity will usually have an effect on the duration, but this is not a simple “straightline” orlinear relationship. Sometimes, the intrinsic nature of the work (i.e., constraints imposed on the duration, effort involved,r number of resources) will take a predetermined amount of time to complete regardless of the resource allocation(e.g., a 24hour stress test). Other factors for consideration when estimating duration include: Law of diminishing returns. When one factor (e.g., resource) used to determine the effort required to produce aunit of work is increased while all other factors remain fixed, a point will eventually be reached at which additionsf that one factor start to yield progressively smaller or diminishing increases in output. Number of resources. Increasing the number of resources to twice the original number of the resources doesnot always reduce the time by half, as it may increase extra duration due to risk, and at some point addingtoo many resources to the activity may increase duration due to knowledge transfer, learning curve, additionalcoordination, and other factors involved. Advances in technology. This may also play an important role in determining duration estimates. For example, anincrease in the output of a manufacturing plant may be achieved by procuring the latest advances in technology,which may impact duration and resource needs. Motivation of staff. The project manager also needs to be aware of Student Syndrome—or procrastination—when people start to apply themselves only at the last possible moment before the deadline, and Parkinson’s Lawwhere work expands to fill the time available for its completion.All data and assumptions that support duration estimating are documented for each activity duration estimate.1976.4.1 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: INPUTS ',\n",

       " ' 2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATINGAnalogous estimating is a technique for estimating the duration or cost of an activity or a project using historicaldata from a similar activity or project. Analogous estimating uses parameters from a previous, similar project, such asduration, budget, size, weight, and complexity, as the basis for estimating the same parameter or measure for a futureproject. When estimating durations, this technique relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects as the basisfor estimating the duration of the current project. It is a gross value estimating approach, sometimes adjusted for knowndifferences in project complexity. Analogous duration estimating is frequently used to estimate project duration whenthere is a limited amount of detailed information about the project.Analogous estimating is generally less costly and less timeconsuming than other techniques, but it is alsoless accurate. Analogous duration estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project and maybe used in conjunction with other estimating methods. Analogous estimating is most reliable when the previousactivities are similar in fact and not just in appearance, and the project team members preparing the estimateshave the needed expertise. ',\n",
       " ' 3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATINGParametric estimating is an estimating technique in which an algorithm is used to calculate cost or duration basedn historical data and project parameters. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between historical dataand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate an estimate for activity parameters, such as cost,budget, and duration.200 Durations can be quantitatively determined by multiplying the quantity of work to be performed by the number of laborhours per unit of work. For example, duration on a design project is estimated by the number of drawings multiplied bythe number of labor hours per drawing, or on a cable installation, the meters of cable multiplied by the number of laborhours per meter. If the assigned resource is capable of installing 25 meters of cable per hour, the duration required toinstall 1,000 meters is 40 hours (1,000 meters divided by 25 meters per hour).This technique can produce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built intothe model. Parametric schedule estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunctionwith other estimating methods. ',\n",
       " ' 4 THREEPOINT ESTIMATINGThe accuracy of singlepoint duration estimates may be improved by considering estimation uncertainty and risk.Using threepoint estimates helps define an approximate range for an activity’s duration: Most likely (tM). This estimate is based on the duration of the activity, given the resources likely to be assigned,their productivity, realistic expectations of availability for the activity, dependencies on other participants, andinterruptions. Optimistic (tO). The activity duration based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity. Pessimistic (tP). The duration based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected duration, tE,can be calculated. One commonly used formula is triangular distribution:tE (tO + iM + tP)/ 3.Triangular distribution is used when there is insufficient historical data or when using judgmental data. Durationestimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected duration and clarify the range ofuncertainty around the expected duration.201 ',\n",
       " ' 5 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATINGBottomup estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lowerlevel components of the WBS. When an activity’s duration cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of confidence,the work wihin the activity is decomposed into more detail. The detail durations are estimated. These estimates arethen aggregated into a total quantity for each of the activity’s durations. Activities may or may not have dependenciesbetween theusage is ref that can affect the application and use of resources. If there are dependencies, this pattern of resourcelected and documented in the estimated requirements of the activity. ',\n",
       " ' 6 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is used to compare various levels of resource capability or skills;scheduling compression techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.6); different tools (manual versus automated);and make, rent, or buy decisions regarding the resources. This allows the team to weigh resource, cost, andduration variables to determine an optimal approach for accomplishing project work. Reserve analysis. Reserve analysis is used to determine the amount of contingency and management reserveneeded for the project. Duration estimates may include contingency reserves, sometimes referred to as schedulereserves, to account for schedule uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the estimated duration within the schedulebaseline, which is allocated for identified risks that are accepted. Contingency reserves are associated with theknownunknowns, which may be estimated to account for this unknown amount of rework. The contingencyreserve may be a percentage of the estimated activity duration or a fixed number of work periods. Contingencyreserves may be separated from the individual activities and aggregated. As more precise information about theproject becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced, or eliminated. Contingency should beclearly identified in the schedule documentation.Estimates may also be produced for the amount of management reserve of schedule for the project. Managementreserves are a specified amount of the project budget withheld for management control purposes and arereserved for unforeseen work that is within scope of the project. Management reserves are intended to addressthe unknownunknowns that can affect a project. Management reserve is not included in the schedule baseline,but it is part of the overall project duration requirements. Depending on contract terms, use of managementreserves may require a change to the schedule baseline.202  ',\n",

One variation of the voting method that is often used in agilebased projects is called the fist of five (also calledfist to five). In this technique, the project manager asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holdingup a closed fist (indicating no support) up to five fingers (indicating full support). If a team member holds up fewer thanthree fingers, the team member is given the opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The project managercontinues the fistoffive process until the team achieves consensus (everyone holds up three or more fingers) or agreesto move on to the next decision. ',\n",
       " ' 8 MEETINGSThe project team may hold meetings to estimate activity durations. When using an agile approach, it is necessaryto conduct sprint or iteration planning meetings to discuss prioritized product backlog items (user stories) and decidewhich of these items the team will commit to work on in the upcoming iteration. The team breaks down user stories to lowlevel tasks, with estimates in hours, and then validates that the estimates are achievable based on team capacityver the duration (iteration). This meeting is usually held on the first day of the iteration and is attended by the productwner, the Scrum team, and the project manager. The outcome of the meeting includes an iteration backlog, as well asassumptions, concerns, risks, dependencies, decisions, and actions.6.4.3 ESTIMATE ACTIVITY DURATIONS: OUTPUTS ',\n",

The key benefit of thisprocess is that it generates a schedule model with planned dates for completing project activities. This processis performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted inFigure 614. Figure 615 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.205206 Developing an acceptable project schedule is an iterative process. The schedule model is used to determine theplanned start and finish dates for project activities and milestones based on the best available information. Scheduledevelopment can require the review and revision of duration estimates, resource estimates, and schedule reserves toestablish an approved project schedule that can serve as a baseline to track progress. Key steps include defining theproject milestones, identifying and sequencing activities, and estimating durations. Once the activity start and finishdates have been determined, it is common to have the project staff assigned to the activities review their assignedactivities. The staff confirms that the start and finish dates present no conflict with resource calendars or assignedactivities on other projects or tasks and thus are still valid. The schedule is then analyzed to determine conflicts withlogical relationships and if resource leveling is required before the schedule is approved and baselined.

It employsseveral other techniques such as critical path method (described in Section 6.5.2.2), resource optimization techniques(described in Section 6.5.2.3), and modeling techniques (described in Section 6.5.2.4). Additional analysis includes butis not limited to: Assessing the need to aggregate schedule reserves to reduce the probability of a schedule slip when multiplepaths converge at a single point in time or when multiple paths diverge from a single point in time, to reduce theprobability of a schedule slip. Reviewing the network to see if the critical path has highrisk activities or long lead items that would necessitateuse of schedule reserves or the implementation of risk responses to reduce the risk on the critical path.Schedule network analysis is an iterative process that is employed until a viable schedule model is developed.2096.5.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHODThe critical path method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of scheduleflexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. This schedule network analysis technique calculatesthe early start, early finish, late start, and late finish dates for all activities without regard for any resource limitationsby performing a forward and backward pass analysis through the schedule network, as shown in Figure 616. In thisexample, the longest path includes activities A, C, and D, and therefore the sequence of ACD is the critical path.The critical path is the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determinesthe shortest possible project duration. The longest path has the least total float—usually zero. The resulting earlyand late start and finish dates are not necessarily the project schedule; rather they indicate the time periods withinwhich the activity could be executed, using the parameters entered in the schedule model for activity durations, logicalrelationships, leads, lags, and other known constraints. The critical path method is used to calculate the critical path(s)and the amount of total and free float or schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model.On any network path, the total float or schedule flexibility is measured by the amount of time that a scheduleactivity can be delayed or extended from its early start date without delaying the project finish date or violating aschedule constraint. A critical path is normally characterized by zero total float on the critical path. As implementedwith the precedence diagramming method sequencing, critical paths may have positive, zero, or negative total floatdepending on the constraints applied. Positive total float is caused when the backward pass is calculated from aschedule constraint that is later than the early finish date that has been calculated during forward pass calculation.Negative total float is caused when a constraint on the late dates is violated by duration and logic. Negative floatanalysis is a technique that helps to find possible accelerated ways of bringing a delayed schedule back on track.Schedule networks may have multiple nearcritical paths. Many software packages allow the user to define theparameters used to determine the critical path(s). Adjustments to activity durations (when more resources or lessscope can be arranged), logical relationships (when the relationships were discretionary to begin with), leads andlags, or other schedule constraints may be necessary to produce network paths with a zero or positive total float.Once the total float and the free float have been calculated, the free float is the amount of time that a scheduleactivity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any successor or violating a schedule constraint. Forexample the free float for Activity B, in Figure 616, is 5 days.210 6.5.2.3 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATIONResource optimization is used to adjust the start and finish dates of activities to adjust planned resource use to beequal to or less than resource availability. Examples of resource optimization techniques that can be used to adjust theschedule model due to demand and supply of resources include but are not limited to: Resource leveling. A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints withthe goal of balancing the demand for resources with the available supply. Resource leveling can be used whenshared or critically required resources are available only at certain times or in limited quantities, or are overallocated, such as when a resource has been assigned to two or more activities during the same time period (asshown in Figure 617), or there is a need to keep resource usage at a constant level. Resource leveling can oftencause the original critical path to change. Available float is used for leveling resources. Consequently, the criticalpath through the project schedule may change. Resource smoothing. A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements forresources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. In resource smoothing, as opposed toresource leveling, the project’s critical path is not changed and the completion date may not be delayed. In otherwords, activities may only be delayed within their free and total float. Resource smoothing may not be able toptimize all resources.211212 6.5.2.4 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Whatif scenario analysis. Whatif scenario analysis is the process of evaluating scenarios in order to predicttheir effect, positive or negative, on project objectives. This is an analysis of the question, “What if the situationrepresented by scenario X happens?” A schedule network analysis is performed using the schedule to computethe different scenarios, such as delaying a major component delivery, extending specific engineering durations,r introducing external factors, such as a strike or a change in the permit process. The outcome of the whatifscenario analysis can be used to assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, and inpreparing schedule reserves and response plans to address the impact of unexpected situations. Simulation. Simulation models the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertaintyto evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. The most common simulation technique isMonte Carlo analysis (see Section 11.4.2.5), in which risks and other sources of uncertainty are used to calculatepossible schedule outcomes for the total project. Simulation involves calculating multiple work package durationswith different sets of activity assumptions, constraints, risks, issues, or scenarios using probability distributionsand other representations of uncertainty (see Section 11.4.2.4). Figure 618 shows a probability distribution for aproject with the probability of achieving a certain target date (i.e., project finish date). In this example, there is a10% probability that the project will finish on or before the target date of May 13, while there is a 90% probabilityf completing the project by May 28.213For more information on how Monte Carlo simulation is used for schedule models, see the Practice Standardfor Scheduling.6.5.2.5 LEADS AND LAGSDescribed in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 3. Leads and lags are refinements applied during network analysis to develop a viableschedule by adjusting the start time of the successor activities. Leads are used in limited circumstances to advance asuccessor activity with respect to the predecessor activity, and lags are used in limited circumstances where processesrequire a set period of time to elapse between the predecessors and successors without work or resource impact.214 6.5.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREIONSchedule compression techniques are used to shorten or accelerate the schedule duration without reducing theproject scope in order to meet schedule constraints, imposed dates, or other schedule objectives. A helpful techniqueis the negative float analysis. The critical path is the one with the least float. Due to violating a constraint or imposeddate, the total float can become negative. Schedule compression techniques are compared in Figure 619 and include: Crashing. A technique used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.Examples of crashing include approving overtime, bringing in additional resources, or paying to expedite deliveryto activities on the critical path. Crashing works only for activities on the critical path where additional resourceswill shorten the activity’s duration. Crashing does not always produce a viable alternative and may result inincreased risk and/or cost. Fast tracking. A schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequenceare performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for abuilding before completing all of the architectural drawings. Fast tracking may result in rework and increasedrisk. Fast tracking only works when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration on the criticalpath. Using leads in case of schedule acceleration usually increases coordination efforts between the activitiesconcerned and increases quality risk. Fast tracking may also increase project costs.2156.5.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that expeditesthe process of building a schedule model by generating start and finish dates based on the inputs of activities, networkdiagrams, resources, and activity durations.6.5.2.8 AGILE RELEASE PLANNINGAgile release planning provides a highlevel summary timeline of the release schedule (typically 3 to 6 months)based on the product roadmap and the product vision for the product’s evolution. Agile release planning alsodetermines the number of iterations or sprints in the release, and allows the product owner and team to decidehow much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals,dependencies, and impediments.Since features represent value to the customer, the timeline provides a more easily understood project scheduleas it defines which feature will be available at the end of each iteration, which is exactly the depth of information thecustomer is looking for.Figure 620 shows the relationship among product vision, product roadmap, release planning, and iteration planning.216 6.5.3 DEVELOP SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS6.5.3.1 SCHEDULE BASELINEAschedule baseline is the approved version of a schedule model that can be changed only through formal changecontrol procedures and is used as a basis for comparison to actual results. It is accepted and approved by the appropriatestakeholders as the schedule baseline with baseline start dates and baseline finish dates. During monitoring andcontrolling, the approved baseline dates are compared to the actual start and finish dates to determine if variances haveccurred. The schedule baseline is a component of the project management plan.6.5.3.2 PROJECT SCHEDULEThe project schedule is an output of a schedule model that presents linked activities with planned dates, durations,ilestones, and resources. At a minimum, the project schedule includes a planned start date and planned finish datefor each activity. If resource planning is done at an early stage, the project schedule remains preliminary until resourceassignments have been confirmed and scheduled start and finish dates are established. This process usually occurs nolater than the completion of the project management plan (Section 4.2.3.1). A target project schedule model may alsobe developed with a defined target start and target finish for each activity. The project schedule may be presented insummary form, sometimes referred to as the master schedule or milestone schedule, or presented in detail. Althougha project schedule model can be presented in tabular form, it is more often presented graphically, using one or more ofthe following formats: Bar charts. Also known as Gantt charts, bar charts represent schedule information where activities are listedn the vertical axis, dates are shown on the horizontal axis, and activity durations are shown as horizontalbars placed according to start and finish dates. Bar charts are relatively easy to read and are commonly used.Depending on the audience, float can be depicted or not. For control and management communications, thebroader, more comprehensive summary activity is used between milestones or across multiple interdependentwork packages and is displayed in bar chart reports. An example is the summary schedule portion of Figure 621that is presented in a WBSstructured format.217 Milestone charts. These charts are similar to bar charts, but only identify the scheduled start or completion ofajor deliverables and key external interfaces. An example is the milestone schedule portion of Figure 621. Project schedule network diagrams. These diagrams are commonly presented in the activityonnodediagram format showing activities and relationships without a time scale, sometimes referred to as a purelogic diagram, as shown in Figure 611, or presented in a timescaled schedule network diagram format thatis sometimes called a logic bar chart, as shown for the detailed schedule in Figure 621. These diagrams, withactivity date information, usually show both the project network logic and the project’s critical path scheduleactivities. This example also shows how each work package is planned as a series of related activities.Another presentation of the project schedule network diagram is a timescaled logic diagram. These diagramsinclude a time scale and bars that represent the duration of activities with the logical relationships. They areptimized to show the relationships between activities where any number of activities may appear on thesame line of the diagram in sequence.Figure 621 shows schedule presentations for a sample project being executed, with the work in progress reportedthrough asof date or status date. For a simple project schedule model, Figure 621 reflects schedule presentations inthe forms of (1) a milestone schedule as a milestone chart, (2) a summary schedule as a bar chart, and (3) a detailedschedule as a project schedule linked bar chart diagram. Figure 621 also visually shows the relationships among thedifferent levels of detail of the project schedule.218 2196.5.3.3 SCHEDULE DATAThe schedule data for the project schedule model is the collection of information for describing and controlling theschedule. The schedule data includes, at a minimum, the schedule milestones, schedule activities, activity attributes,and documentation of all identified assumptions and constraints. The amount of additional data varies by applicationarea. Information frequently supplied as supporting detail includes but is not limited to: Resource requirements by time period, often in the form of a resource histogram; Alternative schedules, such as bestcase or worstcase, not resourceleveled or resourceleveled, or with orwithout imposed dates; and Applied schedule reserves.Schedule data could also include such items as resource histograms, cashflow projections, order and deliveryschedules, or other relevant information.6.5.3.4 PROJECT CALENDARSA project calendar identifies working days and shifts that are available for scheduled activities. It distinguishestime periods in days or parts of days that are available to complete scheduled activities from time periods that are notavailable for work. A schedule model may require more than one project calendar to allow for different work periods forsome activities to calculate the project schedule. The project calendars may be updated.6.5.3.5 CHANGE REQUESTSDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Modifications to the project scope or project schedule may result in change requeststo the scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed forreview and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions mayinclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.220 6.5.3.6 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a changerequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 1. The schedule management plan may be updated toreflect a change in the way the schedule was developed and will be managed. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response toapproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that arevised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.6.5.3.7 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Activity attributes. Described in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 2. Activity attributes are updated to include any revised resourcerequirements and any other revisions generated by the Develop Schedule process. Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. The assumption log may be updated with changes to assumptionsin duration, resource utilization, sequencing, or other information that is revealed as a result of developing theschedule model. Duration estimates. Described in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 1. The number and availability of resources, along with theactivity dependencies can result in a change to the duration estimates. If the resourceleveling analysis changesthe resource requirements, then the duration estimates will likely need to be updated as well. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated withtechniques that were efficient and effective in developing the schedule model. Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource leveling can have a significant effect onpreliminary estimates for the types and quantities of resources required. If the resourceleveling analysis changesthe resource requirements, then the resource requirements are updated. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may need to be updated to reflect opportunities orthreats perceived through scheduling assumptions.2216.6 CONTROL SCHEDULEControl Schedule is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project schedule and managingchanges to the schedule baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the schedule baseline is maintained throughoutthe project. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of thisprocess are depicted in Figure 622. Figure 623 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.222 Updating the schedule model requires knowing the actual performance to date. Any change to the schedule baselinecan only be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Control Schedule, as acomponent of the Perform Integrated Change Control process, is concerned with: Determining the current status of the project schedule, Influencing the factors that create schedule changes, Reconsidering necessary schedule reserves, Determining if the project schedule has changed, and Managing the actual changes as they occur.223When an agile approach is used, Control Schedule is concerned with: Determining the current status of the project schedule by comparing the total amount of work delivered andaccepted against the estimates of work completed for the elapsed time cycle; Conducting retrospectives (scheduled reviews to record lessons learned) for correcting processes and improving,if required; Reprioritizing the remaining work plan (backlog); Determining the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted (velocity) in the given timeper iteration (agreedupon work cycle duration, typically 2 weeks or 1 month); Determining that the project schedule has changed; and Managing the actual changes as they occur.When work is being contracted, regular and milestone status updates from contractors and suppliers are a means ofensuring the work is progressing as agreed upon to ensure the schedule is under control. Scheduled status reviews andwalkthroughs should be done to ensure the contractor reports are accurate and complete.6.6.1 CONTROL SCHEDULE: INPUTS6.6.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 1. The schedule management describes the frequencythat the schedule will be updated, how reserve will be used, and how the schedule will be controlled. Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. The schedule baseline is compared with actual results todetermine if a change, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The project WBS, deliverables, constraints, and assumptionsdocumented in the scope baseline are considered explicitly when monitoring and controlling the schedulebaseline. Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis theperformance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, orpreventive action is necessary.224 6.6.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied tolater phases in the project to improve schedule control. Project calendars. Described in Section 6.5.3.4. A schedule model may require more than one project calendarto allow for different work periods for some activities to calculate the schedule forecasts. Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Project schedule refers to the most recent version with notationsto indicate updates, completed activities, and started activities as of the indicated date. Resource calendars. Described in Section 9.2.1.2. Resource calendars show the availability of team andphysical resources. Schedule data. Described in Section 6.5.3.3. Schedule data will be reviewed and updated in the ControlSchedule process.6.6.1.3 WORK PERFORMANCE DATADescribed in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which activities havestarted, their progress (e.g., actual duration, remaining duration, and physical percent complete), and which activitieshave finished.6.6.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Control Schedule process include but are not limited to: Existing formal and informal schedule controlrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines; Schedule control tools; and Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.2256.6.2 CONTROL SCHEDULE: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES6.6.2.1 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used for this process include but are not limited to: Earned value analysis. Described in Section 7.4.2.2. Schedule performance measurements such as schedulevariance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) are used to assess the magnitude of variation to the originalschedule baseline. Iteration burndown chart. This chart tracks the work that remains to be completed in the iteration backlog. Itis used to analyze the variance with respect to an ideal burndown based on the work committed from iterationplanning (see Section  ',\n",
       " ' 8). A forecast trend line can be used to predict the likely variance at iterationcompletion and take appropriate actions during the course of the iteration. A diagonal line representing the idealburndown and daily actual remaining work is then plotted. A trend line is then calculated to forecast completionbased on remaining work. Figure 624 is an example of an iteration burndown chart.226  Performance reviews. Performance reviews measure, compare, and analyze schedule performance againstthe schedule baseline such as actual start and finish dates, percent complete, and remaining duration for workin progress. Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determinewhether performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understandingperformance to date and for comparing to future performance goals in the form of completion dates. Variance analysis. Variance analysis looks at variances in planned versus actual start and finish dates, plannedversus actual durations, and variances in float. Part of variance analysis is determining the cause and degree ofvariance relative to the schedule baseline (see Section 6.5.3.1), estimating the implications of those variancesfor future work to completion, and deciding whether corrective or preventive action is required. For example, aajor delay on any activity not on the critical path may have little effect on the overall project schedule, while auch shorter delay on a critical or nearcritical activity may require immediate action. Whatif scenario analysis. Described in Section 6.5.2.4. Whatif scenario analysis is used to assess the variousscenarios guided by the output from the Project Risk Management processes to bring the schedule model intoalignment with the project management plan and approved baseline.6.6.2.2 CRITICAL PATH METHODDescribed in Section 6.5.2.2. Comparing the progress along the critical path can help determine schedule status. Thevariance on the critical path will have a direct impact on the project end date. Evaluating the progress of activities onnear critical paths can identify schedule risk.6.6.2.3 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems include scheduling software that providesthe ability to track planned dates versus actual dates, to report variances to and progress made against the schedulebaseline, and to forecast the effects of changes to the project schedule model.6.6.2.4 RESOURCE OPTIMIZATIONDescribed in Section 6.5.2.3. Resource optimization techniques involve the scheduling of activities and the resourcesrequired by those activities while taking into consideration both the resource availability and the project time.2276.6.2.5 LEADS AND LAGSAdjusting leads and lags is applied during network analysis to find ways to bring project activities that are behind intoalignment with the plan. For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping can be adjusted tostart before the exterior work of the building is completed by increasing the lead time in the relationship, or a technicalwriting team can adjust the start of editing the draft of a large document immediately after the document is written byeliminating or decreasing lag time.6.6.2.6 SCHEDULE COMPREIONSchedule compression techniques (see Section 6.5.2.6) are used to find ways to bring project activities that arebehind into alignment with the plan by fast tracking or crashing the schedule for the remaining work.6.6.3 CONTROL SCHEDULE: OUTPUTS6.6.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATIONDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project workis performing compared to the schedule baseline. Variances in the start and finish dates and the durations can becalculated at the work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, the (SV) and(SPI) are documented for inclusion in work performance reports (see Section 4.5.3.1).6.6.3.2 SCHEDULE FORECASTSSchedule updates are forecasts of estimates or predictions of conditions and events in the projects future based oninformation and knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are updated and reissued based on workperformance information provided as the project is executed. The information is based on the projects past performanceand expected future performance based on corrective or preventive actions. This can include earned value performanceindicators, as well as schedule reserve information that could impact the project in the future.228 6.6.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTSDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Schedule variance analysis, as well as reviews of progress reports, results of performanceeasures, and modifications to the project scope or project schedule, may result in change requests to the schedulebaseline, scope baseline, and/or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processedfor review and disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Preventive actions mayinclude recommended changes to eliminate or reduce the probability of negative schedule variances.6.6.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a changerequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section  ',\n",

       "' 5 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a changerequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Schedule baseline. Described in Section 6.5.3.1. Throughout the project, work packages are progressivelyelaborated into activities. This process may reveal work that was not part of the initial schedule baseline,necessitating a change to delivery dates or other significant schedule milestones that are part of theschedule baseline. Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response toapproved changes in schedule activities.186 6.3 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIESSequence Activities is the process of identifying and documenting relationships among the project activities. The keybenefit of this process is that it defines the logical sequence of work to obtain the greatest efficiency given all projectconstraints. This process is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of thisprocess are depicted in Figure 67. Figure 68 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.187Every activity except the first and last should be connected to at least one predecessor and at least one successoractivity with an appropriate logical relationship. Logical relationships should be designed to create a realistic projectschedule. It may be necessary to use lead or lag time between activities to support a realistic and achievable projectschedule. Sequencing can be performed by using project management software or by using manual or automatedtechniques. The Sequence Activities process concentrates on converting the project activities from a list to a diagram toact as a first step to publish the schedule baseline.6.3.1 SEQUENCE ACTIVITIES: INPUTS '"
