      "managing, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget. The Project Cost\n",

      "Figure 7-1 provides an overview of the Project Cost Management processes. The Project Cost Management processes\n",
      "are presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces, while in practice they overlap and interact in ways that\n",
      "cannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK® Guide. These processes interact with each other and with processes in\n",
      "other Knowledge Areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "On some projects, especially those of smaller scope, cost estimating and cost budgeting are tightly linked and can\n",
      "be viewed as a single process that can be performed by a single person over a relatively short period of time. They are\n",
      "presented here as distinct processes because the tools and techniques for each are different. The ability to influence\n",
      "cost is greatest at the early stages of the project, making early scope definition critical (see Section 5.3).\n",
      "\n",
      "231\n",
      "232 Part 1 - Guide\n",
      "KEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "Project Cost Management is primarily concerned with the cost of the resources needed to complete project activities.\n",
      "Project Cost Management should consider the effect of project decisions on the subsequent recurring cost of using,\n",
      "maintaining, and supporting the product, service, or result of the project. For example, limiting the number of design\n",
      "reviews can reduce the cost of the project but could increase the resulting product’s operating costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another aspect of cost management is recognizing that different stakeholders measure project costs in different\n",
      "ways and at different times. For example, the cost of an acquired item may be measured when the acquisition decision\n",
      "is made or committed, the order is placed, the item is delivered, or the actual cost is incurred or recorded for project\n",
      "accounting purposes. In many organizations, predicting and analyzing the prospective financial performance of\n",
      "the project’s product is performed outside of the project. In others, such as a capital facilities project, Project Cost\n",
      "Management can include this work. When such predictions and analyses are included, Project Cost Management may\n",
      "address additional processes and numerous general financial management techniques such as return on investment,\n",
      "discounted cash flow, and investment payback analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "TRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "Within the practice of Project Cost Management, trends include the expansion of earned value management (EVM) to\n",
      "include the concept of earned schedule (ES).\n",
      "\n",
      "ES is an extension to the theory and practice of EVM. Earned schedule theory replaces the schedule variance\n",
      "measures used in traditional EVM (earned value - planned value) with ES and actual time (AT). Using the alternate\n",
      "equation for calculating schedule variance ES - AT, if the amount of earned schedule is greater than 0, then the project\n",
      "is considered ahead of schedule. In other words, the project earned more than planned at a given point in time. The\n",
      "schedule performance index (SPI) using earned schedule metrics is ES/AT. This indicates the efficiency with which work\n",
      "is being accomplished. Earned schedule theory also provides formulas for forecasting the project completion date, using\n",
      "earned schedule, actual time, and estimated duration.\n",
      "\n",
      "233\n",
      "TAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\n",
      "Because each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Cost Management processes\n",
      "\n",
      "are applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Knowledge management. Does the organization have a formal knowledge management and financial database\n",
      "repository that a project manager is required to use and that is readily accessible?\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Estimating and budgeting. Does the organization have existing formal or informal cost estimating and\n",
      "budgeting-related policies, procedures, and guidelines?\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Earned value management. Does the organization use earned value management in managing projects?\n",
      "\n",
      "@ Use of agile approach. Does the organization use agile methodologies in managing projects? How does this\n",
      "impact cost estimating?\n",

      "\n",
      "CONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\n",
      "\n",
      "Projects with high degrees of uncertainty or those where the scope is not yet fully defined may not benefit from\n",
      "detailed cost calculations due to frequent changes. Instead, lightweight estimation methods can be used to generate a\n",
      "fast, high-level forecast of project labor costs, which can then be easily adjusted as changes arise. Detailed estimates\n",
      "are reserved for short-term planning horizons in a just-in-time fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In cases where high-variability projects are also subject to strict budgets, the scope and schedule are more often\n",

       "'PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT\\n\\nProject Cost Management includes the processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding,anaging, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget. The Project Cost\\nManagement processes are:\\n\\n7.1 Plan Cost Management—The process of defining how the project costs will be estimated, budgeted, managed,onitored, and controlled.\\n\\n7.2 Estimate Costs—The process of developing an approximation of the monetary resources needed to complete\\nproject work.\\n\\n7.3 Determine Budget—The process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to\\nestablish an authorized cost baseline.\\n\\n7.4 Control Costs—The process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project costs and manage\\nchanges to the cost baseline.\\n\\nFigure 71 provides an overview of the Project Cost Management processes. The Project Cost Management processes\\nare presented as discrete processes with defined interfaces, while in practice they overlap and interact in ways that\\ncannot be completely detailed in the PMBOK® Guide. These processes interact with each other and with processes inther Knowledge Areas.\\n\\nOn some projects, especially those of smaller scope, cost estimating and cost budgeting are tightly linked and can\\nbe viewed as a single process that can be performed by a single person over a relatively short period of time. They are\\npresented here as distinct processes because the tools and techniques for each are different. The ability to influence\\ncost is greatest at the early stages of the project, making early scope definition critical (see Section 5.3).\\n\\n231\\n232 \\nKEY CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT\\n\\nProject Cost Management is primarily concerned with the cost of the resources needed to complete project activities.\\nProject Cost Management should consider the effect of project decisions on the subsequent recurring cost of using,aintaining, and supporting the product, service, or result of the project. For example, limiting the number of design\\nreviews can reduce the cost of the project but could increase the resulting product’s operating costs.\\n\\nAnother aspect of cost management is recognizing that different stakeholders measure project costs in different\\nways and at different times. For example, the cost of an acquired item may be measured when the acquisition decision\\nis made or committed, the order is placed, the item is delivered, or the actual cost is incurred or recorded for project\\naccounting purposes. In many organizations, predicting and analyzing the prospective financial performance of\\nthe project’s product is performed outside of the project. In others, such as a capital facilities project, Project Cost\\nManagement can include this work. When such predictions and analyses are included, Project Cost Management may\\naddress additional processes and numerous general financial management techniques such as return on investment,\\ndiscounted cash flow, and investment payback analysis.\\n\\nTRENDS AND EMERGING PRACTICES IN PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT\\n\\nWithin the practice of Project Cost Management, trends include the expansion of earned value management (EVM) to\\ninclude the concept of earned schedule (ES).\\n\\nES is an extension to the theory and practice of EVM. Earned schedule theory replaces the schedule varianceeasures used in traditional EVM (earned value  planned value) with ES and actual time (AT). Using the alternate\\nequation for calculating schedule variance ES  AT, if the amount of earned schedule is greater than 0, then the project\\nis considered ahead of schedule. In other words, the project earned more than planned at a given point in time. The\\nschedule performance index (SPI) using earned schedule metrics is ES/AT. This indicates the efficiency with which work\\nis being accomplished. Earned schedule theory also provides formulas for forecasting the project completion date, using\\nearned schedule, actual time, and estimated duration.\\n\\n233\\nTAILORING CONSIDERATIONS\\nBecause each project is unique, the project manager may need to tailor the way Project Cost Management processes\\n\\nare applied. Considerations for tailoring include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Knowledge management. Does the organization have a formal knowledge management and financial database\\nrepository that a project manager is required to use and that is readily accessible?\\n\\n Estimating and budgeting. Does the organization have existing formal or informal cost estimating and\\nbudgetingrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines?\\n\\n Earned value management. Does the organization use earned value management in managing projects?\\n\\n Use of agile approach. Does the organization use agile methodologies in managing projects? How does this\\nimpact cost estimating?\\n\\n Governance. Does the organization have formal or informal audit and governance policies, procedures, and guidelines?\\n\\nCONSIDERATIONS FOR AGILE/ADAPTIVE ENVIRONMENTS\\n\\nProjects with high degrees of uncertainty or those where the scope is not yet fully defined may not benefit from\\ndetailed cost calculations due to frequent changes. Instead, lightweight estimation methods can be used to generate a\\nfast, highlevel forecast of project labor costs, which can then be easily adjusted as changes arise. Detailed estimates\\nare reserved for shortterm planning horizons in a justintime fashion.\\n\\nIn cases where highvariability projects are also subject to strict budgets, the scope and schedule are more often\\nadjusted to stay within cost constraints.\\n\\n234 \\n7.1 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT\\n\\nPlan Cost Management is the process of defining how the project costs will be estimated, budgeted, managed,onitored, and controlled. The key benefit of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how the project\\ncosts will be managed throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The\\ninputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 72. Figure 73 depicts the data flow\\ndiagram of the process.\\n\\n235\\nThe cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework for each of the costanagement processes so that performance of the processes will be efficient and coordinated. The cost management\\nprocesses and their associated tools and techniques are documented in the cost management plan.

The schedule management\\nplan provides processes and controls that will impact cost estimation and management.\\n\\n Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides the approach for\\nidentifying, analyzing, and monitoring risks. The risk management plan provides processes and controls that will\\nimpact cost estimation and management.\\n\\n7.1.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Cost Management process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Organizational culture and structure can influence cost management.\\n Market conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the regional and global markets.\\n\\n Currency exchange rates for project costs are sourced from more than one country.\\n\\n236 \\n Published commercial information such as resource cost rate information is often available from commercial\\ndatabases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.\\nPublished seller price lists are another source of information.\\n\\n Project management information system provides alternative possibilities for managing cost.\\n\\n Productivity differences in different parts of the world can have a large influence on the cost of projects.\\n\\n7.1.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Cost Management process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Financial controls procedures (e.g., time reporting, required expenditure and disbursement reviews, accounting\\ncodes, and standard contract provisions);\\n\\n Historical information and lessons learned repository;\\n Financial databases; and\\n\\n Existing formal and informal cost estimating and budgetingrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines.\\n\\n7.1.2 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n7.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics:\\n\\n Previous similar projects;\\n Information in the industry, discipline, and application area;\\n Cost estimating and budgeting; and\\n\\n Earned value management.\\n\\n237\\n7.1.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nA data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.\\nAlternatives analysis can include reviewing strategic funding options such as: selffunding, funding with equity, or\\nfunding with debt. It can also include consideration of ways to acquire project resources such as making, purchasing,\\nrenting, or leasing.\\n\\n7.1.2.3 MEETINGS\\n\\nProject teams may hold planning meetings to develop the cost management plan. Attendees may include the projectanager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility for\\nproject costs, and others as needed.\\n\\n7.1.3 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS\\n\\n7.1.3.1. COST MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nThe cost management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how the project costs will\\nbe planned, structured, and controlled. The cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques are\\ndocumented in the cost management plan.\\n\\nFor example, the cost management plan can establish the following:\\n\\n Units of measure. Each unit used in measurements (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures;eters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures; or lump sum in currency form) is defined\\nfor each of the resources.\\n\\n Level of precision. This is the degree to which cost estimates will be rounded up or down (e.g., US$995.59 to\\nUS$1,000), based on the scope of the activities and magnitude of the project.\\n\\n Level of accuracy. The acceptable range (e.g., +10%) used in determining realistic cost estimates is specified,\\nand may include an amount for contingencies.\\n\\n238 \\n Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the\\nframework for the cost management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates, budgets, and controlf costs. The WBS component used for the project cost accounting is called the control account. Each\\ncontrol account is assigned a unique code or account number(s) that links directly to the performingrganization’s accounting system.\\n\\n Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be specified to indicate an\\nagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically\\nexpressed as percentage deviations from the baseline plan.\\n\\n Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules of performance measurement are\\nset. For example, the cost management plan may: Define the points in the WBS at which measurement of control accounts will be performed; Establish the EVM techniques (e.g., weighted milestones, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to be\\nemployed; and Specify tracking methodologies and the EVM computation equations for calculating projected estimate at\\ncompletion (EAC) forecasts to provide a validity check on the bottomup EAC.\\n Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various cost reports are defined.\\n Additional details. Additional details about cost management activities include but are not limited to:\\n Description of strategic funding choices, Procedure to account for fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and Procedure for project cost recording.\\n\\nFor more specific information regarding earned value management, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value\\nManagement  Second Edition [17].\\n\\n7.2 ESTIMATE COSTS\\n\\nEstimate Costs is the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete project\\nwork. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the monetary resources required for the project. This process\\nis performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process\\nare depicted in Figure 74. Figure 75 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n239\\nA cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required to complete the activity. It is a\\nprediction that is based on the information known at a given point in time. Cost estimates include the identification and\\nconsideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project. Cost tradeoffs and risks should be considered,\\nsuch as make versus buy, buy versus lease, and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project.\\n\\nCost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency (i.e., dollars, euros, yen, etc.), although in some\\ninstances other units of measure, such as staff hours or staff days, are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating the\\neffects of currency fluctuations.\\n\\nCost estimates should be reviewed and refined during the course of the project to reflect additional detail as it becomes\\navailable and assumptions are tested. The accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses through\\nthe project life cycle. For example, a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate\\nin the range of 25% to +75%. Later in the project, as more information is known, definitive estimates could narrow\\nthe range of accuracy to 5% to +10%. In some organizations, there are guidelines for when such refinements can beade and the degree of confidence or accuracy that is expected.\\n\\nCosts are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project. This includes but is not limited to labor,aterials, equipment, services, and facilities, as well as special categories such as an inflation allowance, cost of\\nfinancing, or contingency costs. Cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or in summary form.\\n\\n7.2.1 ESTIMATE COSTS: INPUTS\\n\\n7.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes estimating methods\\nthat can be used and the level of precision and accuracy required for the cost estimate.\\n\\n Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The quality management plan describes the activities\\nand resources necessary for the project management team to achieve the quality objectives set for the project.\\n\\n240 \\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,\\nand WBS dictionary:\\n Project scope statement. The scope statement (Section 5.3.3.1) reflects funding constraints by period for the\\nexpenditure of project funds or other financial assumptions and constraints.\\n Work breakdown structure. The WBS (Section 5.4.3.1) provides the relationships among all the project\\ndeliverables and their various components.\\n WBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary (Section 5.4.3.) and related detailed statements of work provide an\\nidentification of the deliverables and a description of the work in each WBS component required to produce\\neach deliverable.\\n\\n7.2.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to\\n\\ndeveloping cost estimates can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precision of\\nthe cost estimates.\\n\\n Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The schedule includes the type, quantity, and amount of time\\nthat team and physical resources will be active on the project. The duration estimates (Section 6.4.3.1) will\\naffect cost estimates when resources are charged per unit of time and when there are seasonal fluctuations\\nin costs. The schedule also provides useful information for projects that incorporate the cost of financing\\n(including interest charges).\\n\\n Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements identify the types and quantitiesf resources required for each work package or activity.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of individual project risks that\\nhave been identified and prioritized, and for which risk responses are required. The risk register provides detailed\\ninformation that can be used to estimate costs.\\n\\n241\\n7.2.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Market conditions. These conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the market,\\nfrom whom, and under what terms and conditions. Regional and/or global supply and demand conditions greatly\\ninfluence resource costs.\\n\\n Published commercial information. Resource cost rate information is often available from commercial\\ndatabases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.\\nPublished seller price lists are another source of information.\\n\\n Exchange rates and inflation. For largescale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the\\nfluctuations of currencies and inflation need to be understood and built into the Estimate Cost process.\\n\\n7.2.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:\\n Cost estimating policies,\\n Cost estimating templates,\\n\\n Historical information and lessons learned repository.\\n\\n7.2.2 ESTIMATE COSTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n7.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics:\\n\\n Previous similar projects;\\n Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; and\\n\\n Cost estimating methods.\\n\\n242 \\n7.2.2.2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.2. Analogous cost estimating uses values, or attributes, of a previous project that are\\nsimilar to the current project. Values and attributes of the projects may include but are not limited to: scope, cost, budget,\\nduration, and measures of scale (e.g., size, weight). Comparison of these project values, or attributes, becomes the basis\\nfor estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project.\\n\\n7.2.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.3. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical data\\nand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This technique can\\nproduce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. Parametric\\ncost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods.\\n\\n7.2.2.4 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.5. Bottomup estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The costf individual work packages or activities is estimated to the greatest level of specified detail. The detailed cost\\nis then summarized or “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost and\\naccuracy of bottomup cost estimating are typically influenced by the size or other attributes of the individual\\nactivity or work package.\\n\\n7.2.2.5 THREEPOINT ESTIMATING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.4. The accuracy of singlepoint cost estimates may be improved by considering estimation\\nuncertainty and risk and using three estimates to define an approximate range for an activity’s cost:\\n\\n Most likely (cM). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and any\\npredicted expenses.\\n\\n Optimistic (cO). The cost based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity.\\n\\n Pessimistic (cP). The cost based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.\\n\\n243\\nDepending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected cost, cE, can\\nbe calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The formulas are:\\n\\n Triangular distribution. cE (cO + cM + cP) / 3\\n Beta distribution. cE (CO + 4cM + cP) / 6\\n\\nCost estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected cost and clarify the range of\\nuncertainty around the expected cost.\\n\\n7.2.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS\\nData analysis techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is a technique used to evaluate identified options in order to select\\nwhich options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work of the project. An example would be\\nevaluating the cost, schedule, resource, and quality impacts of buying versus making a deliverable.\\n\\n Reserve analysis. Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances)\\nto account for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated for\\nidentified risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the known\\nunknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated, while\\nthe amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknown\\namount of rework. Contingency reserves can be provided at any level from the specific activity to the entire\\nproject. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated cost, a fixed number, or may be developed\\nby using quantitative analysis methods.\\n\\nAs more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced,r eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identified in cost documentation. Contingency reserves are part of\\nthe cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project.\\n\\n Cost of quality. Assumptions about costs of quality (Section 8.1.2.3) may be used to prepare the estimates. This\\nincludes evaluating the cost impact of additional investment in conformance versus the cost of nonconformance.\\nIt can also include looking at shortterm cost reductions versus the implication of more frequent problems latern in the product life cycle.\\n\\n244 \\n7.2.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. The project management information system can include spreadsheets, simulation\\nsoftware, and statistical analysis tools to assist with cost estimating. Such tools simplify the use of some costestimating\\ntechniques and thereby facilitate rapid consideration of cost estimate alternatives.\\n\\n7.2.2.8 DECISION MAKING\\n\\nThe decisionmaking techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to voting.\\nDescribed in Section 5.2.2.4, voting is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in\\nthe form of future actions. These techniques are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy and\\ncommitment to the emerging estimates.\\n\\n7.2.3 ESTIMATE COSTS: OUTPUTS\\n\\n7.2.3.1 COST ESTIMATES\\n\\nCost estimates include quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete project work, as well as\\ncontingency amounts to account for identified risks, and management reserve to cover unplanned work. Cost estimates\\ncan be presented in summary form or in detail. Costs are estimated for all resources that are applied to the cost\\nestimate. This includes but is not limited to direct labor, materials, equipment, services, facilities, information technology,\\nand special categories such as cost of financing (including interest charges), an inflation allowance, exchange rates,r a cost contingency reserve. Indirect costs, if they are included in the project estimate, can be included at the activity\\nlevel or at higher levels.\\n\\n245\\n7.2.3.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATES\\n\\nThe amount and type of additional details supporting the cost estimate vary by application area. Regardless of\\nthe level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the cost\\nestimate was derived.\\n\\nSupporting detail for cost estimates may include:\\n\\n Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed),\\n Documentation of all assumptions made,\\n\\n Documentation of any known constraints,\\n\\n Documentation of identified risks included when estimating costs,\\n\\n Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., US$10,000 (+10%) to indicate that the item is expected to\\ncost between a range of values), and\\n\\n Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate.\\n\\n7.2.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. During the Cost Estimates process, new assumptions may beade, new constraints may be identified, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed.\\nThe assumption log should be updated with this new information.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with\\ntechniques that were efficient and effective in developing cost estimates.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may be updated when appropriate risk responses\\nare chosen and agreed upon during the Estimate Cost process.\\n\\n7.3 DETERMINE BUDGET\\n\\nDetermine Budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to\\nestablish an authorized cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the cost baseline against\\nwhich project performance can be monitored and controlled. This process is performed once or at predefined points in\\nthe project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 76. Figure 77 depicts\\nthe data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\nA project budget includes all the funds authorized to execute the project. The cost baseline is the approved version of\\nthe timephased project budget that includes contingency reserves, but excludes management reserves.\\n\\n246 \\nProject\\ncharter\\n\\n247\\n7.3.1 DETERMINE BUDGET: INPUTS\\n\\n7.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes how the project\\ncosts will be structured into the project budget.\\n\\n Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan provides informationn rates (personnel and other resources), estimation of travel costs, and other foreseen costs that are necessary\\nto estimate the overall project budget.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,\\nand WBS dictionary details for cost estimation and management.\\n\\n7.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nExamples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Supporting detail for cost estimates contained in the basis for\\nestimates should specify any basic assumptions dealing with the inclusion or exclusion of indirect or other costs\\nin the project budget.\\n\\n Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates for each activity within a work package are\\naggregated to obtain a cost estimate for each work package.\\n\\n Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The project schedule includes planned start and finish dates\\nfor the project’s activities, milestones, work packages, and control accounts. This information can be used to\\naggregate costs to the calendar periods in which the costs are planned to be incurred.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register should be reviewed to consider how to aggregate\\nthe risk response costs. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates described in\\nSection 11.5.3.3.\\n\\n248 \\n7.3.1.3 BUSINE DOCUMENTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 1.2.6. The business documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but\\nare not limited to:\\n\\n Business case. The business case identifies the critical success factors for the project, including financial\\nsuccess factors.\\n\\n Benefits management plan. The benefits management plan includes the target benefits, such as net present\\nvalue calculations, timeframe for realizing benefits, and the metrics associated with the benefits.\\n7.3.1.4 AGREEMENTS\\nDescribed in Section 12.2.3.2. Applicable agreement information and costs relating to products, services, or results\\nthat have been or will be purchased are included when determining the budget.\\n7.3.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited\\nto exchange rates. For largescale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the fluctuations of\\ncurrencies need to be understood and built into the Determine Budget process.\\n\\n7.3.1.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Determine Budget process include but are not limited to:\\n Existing formal and informal cost budgetingrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines;\\n\\n Historical information and lessons learned repository.\\n\\n Cost budgeting tools; and\\n\\n Reporting methods.\\n\\n249\\n7.3.2 DETERMINE BUDGET: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n7.3.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics:\\n\\n Previous similar projects;\\n Information in the industry, discipline, and application area;\\n Financial principles; and\\n\\n Funding requirement and sources.\\n\\n7.3.2.2 COST AGGREGATION\\n\\nCost estimates are aggregated by work packages in accordance with the WBS. The work package cost estimates\\nare then aggregated for the higher component levels of the WBS (such as control accounts) and, ultimately, for the\\nentire project.\\n\\n7.3.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nA data analysis technique that can be used in the Determine Budget process includes but is not limited to reserve\\nanalysis, which can establish the management reserves for the project. Management reserves are an amount of\\nthe project budget withheld for management control purposes and are reserved for unforeseen work that is within\\nscope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address the unknown unknowns that can affect a project.\\nThe management reserve is not included in the cost baseline but is part of the overall project budget and funding\\nrequirements. When an amount of management reserves is used to fund unforeseen work, the amount of management\\nreserve used is added to the cost baseline, thus requiring an approved change to the cost baseline.\\n\\n250 \\n7.3.2.4 HISTORICAL INFORMATION REVIEW\\n\\nReviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates. Historical\\ninformation may include project characteristics (parameters) to develop mathematical models to predict total project\\ncosts. Such models may be simple (e.g., residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space)r complex (e.g., one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors, each of which\\nhas numerous points within it).\\n\\nBoth the cost and accuracy of analogous and parametric models can vary widely. They are most likely to be\\nreliable when:\\n\\n Historical information used to develop the model is accurate,\\n Parameters used in the model are readily quantifiable, and\\n\\n Models are scalable, such that they work for large projects, small projects, and phases of a project.\\n\\n7.3.2.5 FUNDING LIMIT RECONCILIATION\\n\\nThe expenditure of funds should be reconciled with any funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project.\\nA variance between the funding limits and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the rescheduling of\\nwork to level out the rate of expenditures. This is accomplished by placing imposed date constraints for work into\\nthe project schedule.\\n\\n7.3.2.6 FINANCING\\n\\nFinancing entails acquiring funding for projects. It is common for longterm infrastructure, industrial, and public\\nservices projects to seek external sources of funds. If a project is funded externally, the funding entity may have certain\\nrequirements that are required to be met.\\n\\n251\\n7.3.3 DETERMINE BUDGET: OUTPUTS\\n\\n7.3.3.1 COST BASELINE\\n\\nThe cost baseline is the approved version of the timephased project budget, excluding any management reserves,\\nwhich can only be changed through formal change control procedures. It is used as a basis for comparison to actual\\nresults. The cost baseline is developed as a summation of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities.\\n\\nFigure 78 illustrates the various components of the project budget and cost baseline. Cost estimates for tie va.ious\\nproject activities, along with any contingency reserves (see Section 7.2.2.6) for these activities, are oox,egated\\ninto their associated work package costs. The work package cost estimates, along with any corusec.y reserves\\nestimated for the work packages, are aggregated into control accounts. The summation of 1.2 ec:trol accountsake up the cost baseline. Since the cost estimates that make up the cost baseline are dire cly ticd to the schedule\\nactivities, this enables a timephased view of the cost baseline, which is typically displaye4 1. tie form of an Scurve,\\nas is illustrated in Figure 79. For projects that use earned value management, the ccst Jas «tine is referred to as the\\nperformance measurement baseline.\\n\\nManagement reserves (Section 7.2.2.3) are added to the cost baseline to droduce the project budget. As changes\\nwarranting the use of management reserves arise, the change control preccss ‘s used to obtain approval to move the\\napplicable management reserve funds into the cost baseline.\\n\\n252 \\n253\\n7.3.3.2 PROJECT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS\\n\\nTotal funding requirements and periodic funding requirements (e.g., quarterly, annually) are derived from the cost\\nbaseline. The cost baseline will include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities. Funding often occurs in\\nincremental amounts, and may not be evenly distributed, which appear as steps in Figure 79. The total funds required\\nare those included in the cost baseline plus management reserves, if any. Funding requirements may include the\\nsource(s) of the funding.\\n\\n7.3.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not !.7ic to:\\n Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates are updated to record any a idit. onal information.\\n\\n Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Estimated costs for each activity ma, 1. corded as part of the\\nproject schedule.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks identified durine thi. nrucess are recorded in the risk\\nregister and managed using the risk management processes.\\n\\n7.4 CONTROL COSTS\\n\\nControl Costs is the process of monitoring the status of the projec’. .. update the project costs and managing changes\\nto the cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the cos‘ Luseline is maintained throughout the project. This\\nprocess is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tcsls aid cechniques, and outputs of this process are depicted\\nin Figure 710. Figure 711 depicts the data flow diagram ef cne process.\\n\\n254 \\nProject\\ncharter\\n\\n255\\nUpdating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date. Any increase to the authorized budget cannly be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Monitoring the expenditure of\\nfunds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project, other\\nthan to track the outflow of funds. Much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between the\\nconsumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures. The key to effective cost control\\nis the management of the approved cost baseline.\\n\\nProject cost control includes:\\n\\n Influencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline;\\n Ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner;\\n\\n Managing the actual changes when and as they occur;\\n\\n Ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period, by WBS component, by activity,\\nand in total for the project;\\n\\n Monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved cost baseline;\\n Monitoring work performance against funds expended;\\n\\n Preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource usage;\\n\\n Informing appropriate stakeholders of all approved changes and associated cost; and\\n\\n Bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits.\\n\\n7.4.1 CONTROL COSTS: INPUTS\\n\\n7.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes how the project\\ncosts will be managed and controlled.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline is compared with actual results to determine if a\\nchange, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary.\\n\\n Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis, the\\nperformance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or\\npreventive action is necessary.\\n\\n256 \\n7.4.1.2. PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\n\\nExamples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to the\\nlessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to later\\nphases in the project to improve cost control.\\n\\n7.4.1.3 PROJECT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 7.3.3.2. The project funding requirements include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities.\\n\\n7.4.1.4 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which costs have been\\nauthorized, incurred, invoiced, and paid.\\n\\n7.4.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Control Costs process include but are not limited to:\\n Existing formal and informal cost controlrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines;\\n Cost control tools; and\\n\\n Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.\\n\\n7.4.2 CONTROL COSTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n7.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Examples of expert judgment during the Control Costs process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Variance analysis,\\n Earned value analysis,\\n Forecasting, and\\n\\n Financial analysis.\\n\\n257\\n7.4.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used to control costs include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Earned value analysis (EVA). Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to the\\n\\nactual schedule and cost performance. EVM integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule\\nbaseline to form the performance measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors three key dimensions for\\neach work package and control account:\\n Planned value. Planned value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the authorized\\nbudget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure (WBS) component,\\nnot including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a given\\npoint in time, planned value defines the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of the\\nPY is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total planned value for the\\nproject is also known as budget at completion (BAC).\\n Earned value. Earned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized\\nfor that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The EV beingeasured needs to be related to the PMB, and the EV measured cannot be greater than the authorized\\nPV budget for a component. The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progresseasurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Projectanagers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the long\\nterm performance trends.\\n\\nActual cost. Actual cost (AC) is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a\\nspecific time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The AC\\nneeds to correspond in definition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., direct hoursnly, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spent\\nto achieve the EV will be measured.\\n\\n258\\n\\n\\n Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis, as used in EVM, is the explanation (cause,\\nimpact, and corrective actions) for cost (CV EV  AC), schedule (SV EV  PV), and variance at completion\\n(VAC BAC  EAC) variances. Cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements.\\nFor projects not using formal earned value analysis, similar variance analyses can be performed by comparing\\nplanned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance.\\nFurther analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedule\\nbaseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed. Cost performance measurements are used to assess\\nthe magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline. An important aspect of project cost control includes\\ndetermining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline (see Section 7.3.3.1) and deciding\\nwhether corrective or preventive action is required. The percentage range of acceptable variances will tend to\\ndecrease as more work is accomplished. Examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to:\\n Schedule variance. Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference\\nbetween the earned value and the planned value. It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behind\\nthe planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on a project. It\\nis equal to the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The EVA schedule variance is a useful metric\\nin that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. The EVA schedule\\nvariance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will have\\nbeen earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method (CPM) scheduling and\\nrisk management. Equation: SV EV  PV.\\n\\nCost variance. Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget deficit or surplus at a given point in time, expressed\\nas the difference between earned value and the actual cost. It isa measure of cost performance on a project.\\nIt is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC). The cost variance at the end of the project will\\nbe the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the actual amount spent. The CV is particularly\\ncritical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative CV is often\\ndifficult for the project to recover. Equation: CV EV  AC.\\n\\n259 Schedule performance index. The schedule performance index (SPI) is a measure of schedule efficiency\\n\\nexpressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value. It measures how efficiently the project team is\\naccomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index (CPI) to forecast\\nthe final project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed than\\nwas planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since the\\nSPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine\\nwhether the project will finish ahead of or behind its planned finish date. The SPI is equal to the ratio of the\\nEV to the PV. Equation: SPI EV/PV.\\n\\nCost performance index. The cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost efficiency of budgeted\\nresources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVA metric\\nand measures the cost efficiency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrun\\nfor work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The CPI is\\nequal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: CPI EV/AC.\\n\\n Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine\\n\\nif performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding\\nperformance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of BAC versus estimate at\\ncompletion (EAC) and completion dates. Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to:\\n\\nCharts. In earned value analysis, three parameters of planned value, earned value, and actual cost can benitored and reported on both a periodbyperiod basis (typically weekly or monthly) and on a cumulative\\nbasis. Figure 712 uses Scurves to display EV data for a project that is performing over budget and behind\\nthe schedule.\\n\\n260\\n\\n Forecasting. As the project progresses, the project team may develop a forecast for the estimate at completion\\n(EAC) that may differ from the budget at completion (BAC) based on the project performance. If it becomesbvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Forecasting\\nthe EAC involves making projections of conditions and events in the project’s future based on current\\nperformance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are generated,\\nupdated, and reissued based on work performance data (Section 4.3.3.2) that is provided as the project is\\nexecuted. The work performance information covers the project’s past performance and any information that\\ncould impact the project in the future.\\n\\nEACs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed, plus an estimate to complete (ETC)\\nthe remaining work. It is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the ETC,\\nbased on its experience to date. Earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of the\\nrequired EAC costs. The most common EAC forecasting approach is a manual, bottomup summation by the\\nproject manager and project team.\\n\\nThe project manager’s bottomup EAC method builds upon the actual costs and experience incurred for\\nthe work completed, and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. Equation: EAC =\\nAC + Bottomup ETC.\\n\\n261\\nThe project manager’s manual EAC is quickly compared with a range of calculated EACs representing\\nvarious risk scenarios. When calculating EAC values, the cumulative CPI and SPI values are typically\\nused. While EVM data quickly provide many statistical EACs, only three of the more common methods are\\ndescribed as follows:\\n EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted rate. This EAC method accepts the actual project\\nperformance to date (whether favorable or unfavorable) as represented by the actual costs, and predicts\\nthat all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. When actual performance is unfavorable,\\nthe assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when supported by project\\nrisk analysis. Equation: EAC AC + (BAC  EV).\\n. EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present CPI. This method assumes that what the project has\\nexperienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. The ETC work is assumed to be performed\\nat the same cumulative cost performance index (CPI) as that incurred by the project to date. Equation:\\nEAC BAC / CPI.\\n EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI factors. In this forecast, the ETC work will be\\nperformed at an efficiency rate that considers both the cost and schedule performance indices. Thisethod is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort. Variations of thisethod weight the CPI and SPI at different values (e.g., 80/20, 50/50, or some other ratio) according to\\nthe project manager’s judgment. Equation: EAC AC + [(BAC  EV) / (CPI x SPI)].\\n\\n Reserve analysis. Described in Section 7.2.2.6. During cost control, reserve analysis is used to monitor the\\n\\nstatus of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed or\\nif additional reserves need to be requested. As work on the project progresses, these reserves may be used as\\nplanned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. Conversely, when opportunities are captured\\nand resulting in cost savings, funds may be added to the contingency amount, or taken from the project asargin/profit.\\n\\nIf the identified risks do not occur, the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget to\\nfree up resources for other projects or operations. Additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a need\\nto request that additional reserves be added to the project budget.\\n\\n262\\n\\n\\n7.4.2.3 TOCOMPLETE PERFORMANCE INDEX\\n\\nThe tocomplete performance index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved with\\nthe remaining resources in order to meet a specified management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish\\nthe outstanding work to the remaining budget. TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved on the\\nremaining work to meet a specified management goal, such as the BAC or the EAC. If it becomes obvious that the BAC\\nis no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace che\\nBAC in the TCPI calculation. The equation for the TCP! based on the BAC: (BAC  EV) / (BAC  AC).\\n\\nThe TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 713. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower left a. th: work\\nremaining (defined as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which can be either ti.e CAC ininus the\\nAC, or the EAC minus the AC).\\n\\nIf the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 713), all future work of .5 project will need\\nto be performed immediately in the range of the TCPI (BAC) (as reflected in the top ‘ine o: Figure 713) to stay\\nwithin the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgriet atl based on a number of\\nconsiderations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and technical pe.tor nate. This level of performance\\nis displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for the TCPI is based on the EAx: (BAC  EV) / (EAC  AC). The EVM\\nformulas are provided in Table 71.\\n\\n263\\n264 \\n7.4.2.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems are often used to monitor the three EVM\\ndimensions (PV, EV, and AC), to display graphical trends, and to forecast a range of possible final project results.\\n\\n7.4.3 CONTROL COSTS: OUTPUTS\\n\\n7.4.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work is\\nperforming compared to the cost baseline. Variances in the work performed and the cost of the work are evaluated at\\nthe work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, CV, CPI, EAC, VAC, and TCPI\\nare documented for inclusion in work performance reports (Section 4.5.3.1).\\n\\n265\\n7.4.3.2 COST FORECASTS\\n\\nEither a calculated EAC value or a bottomup EAC value is documented and communicated to stakeholders.\\n\\n7.4.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Analysis of project performance may result in a change request to the cost and\\nschedule baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for review\\nand disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).\\n\\n7.4.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change\\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. Changes to the cost management plan, such as changes\\nto control thresholds or specified levels of accuracy required in managing the project’s cost, are incorporated in\\nresponse to feedback from relevant stakeholders.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to\\napproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a\\nrevised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.\\n\\n Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement\\nbaseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.\\nIn some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the\\nperformance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.\\n\\n266 \\n7.4.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. Cost performance may indicate the need to revise assumptionsn resource productivity and other factors influencing cost performance.\\n\\n Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Cost performance may indicate the need to revisit the orig‘ ia.\\nbasis of estimates.\\n\\n Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates may need to be updated to reflect the «ctu | cost\\nefficiency for the project.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can he updated with\\ntechniques that were effective in maintaining the budget, variance analysis, earned value anv lysis, forecasting,\\nand corrective actions that were used to respond to cost variances.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may be updated if ch: cut variances have crossed,r are likely to cross, the cost threshold.\\n\\n267\\n'"

      "['1 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT\\n\\nPlan Cost Management is the process of defining how the project costs will be estimated, budgeted, managed,onitored, and controlled. The key benefit of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how the project\\ncosts will be managed throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The\\ninputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 72. Figure 73 depicts the data flow\\ndiagram of the process.\\n\\n235\\nThe cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework for each of the costanagement processes so that performance of the processes will be efficient and coordinated. The cost management\\nprocesses and their associated tools and techniques are documented in the cost management plan. The cost management\\nplan is a component of the project management plan.\\n\\n7.1.1 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: INPUTS\\n\\n7.1.1.1. PROJECT CHARTER\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. The project charter provides the preapproved financial resources from which the detailed\\nproject costs are developed. The project charter also defines the project approval requirements that will influence theanagement of the project costs.\\n\\n7.1.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan establishes the\\ncriteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management\\nplan provides processes and controls that will impact cost estimation and management.\\n\\n Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides the approach for\\nidentifying, analyzing, and monitoring risks. The risk management plan provides processes and controls that will\\nimpact cost estimation and management.\\n\\n7.1.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Cost Management process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Organizational culture and structure can influence cost management.\\n Market conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the regional and global markets.\\n\\n Currency exchange rates for project costs are sourced from more than one country.\\n\\n236 \\n Published commercial information such as resource cost rate information is often available from commercial\\ndatabases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.\\nPublished seller price lists are another source of information.\\n\\n Project management information system provides alternative possibilities for managing cost.\\n\\n Productivity differences in different parts of the world can have a large influence on the cost of projects.\\n\\n7.1.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Cost Management process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Financial controls procedures (e.g., time reporting, required expenditure and disbursement reviews, accounting\\ncodes, and standard contract provisions);\\n\\n Historical information and lessons learned repository;\\n Financial databases; and\\n\\n Existing formal and informal cost estimating and budgetingrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines.\\n\\n7.1.2 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n7.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics:\\n\\n Previous similar projects;\\n Information in the industry, discipline, and application area;\\n Cost estimating and budgeting; and\\n\\n Earned value management.\\n\\n237\\n7.1.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nA data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.\\nAlternatives analysis can include reviewing strategic funding options such as: selffunding, funding with equity, or\\nfunding with debt. It can also include consideration of ways to acquire project resources such as making, purchasing,\\nrenting, or leasing.\\n\\n7.1.2.3 MEETINGS\\n\\nProject teams may hold planning meetings to develop the cost management plan. Attendees may include the projectanager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility for\\nproject costs, and others as needed.\\n\\n7.1.3 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS\\n\\n7.1.3.1. COST MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nThe cost management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how the project costs will\\nbe planned, structured, and controlled. The cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques are\\ndocumented in the cost management plan.\\n\\nFor example, the cost management plan can establish the following:\\n\\n Units of measure. Each unit used in measurements (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures;eters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures; or lump sum in currency form) is defined\\nfor each of the resources.\\n\\n Level of precision. This is the degree to which cost estimates will be rounded up or down (e.g., US$995.59 to\\nUS$1,000), based on the scope of the activities and magnitude of the project.\\n\\n Level of accuracy. The acceptable range (e.g., +10%) used in determining realistic cost estimates is specified,\\nand may include an amount for contingencies.\\n\\n238 \\n Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the\\nframework for the cost management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates, budgets, and controlf costs. The WBS component used for the project cost accounting is called the control account. Each\\ncontrol account is assigned a unique code or account number(s) that links directly to the performingrganization’s accounting system.\\n\\n Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be specified to indicate an\\nagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically\\nexpressed as percentage deviations from the baseline plan.\\n\\n Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules of performance measurement are\\nset. For example, the cost management plan may: Define the points in the WBS at which measurement of control accounts will be performed; Establish the EVM techniques (e.g., weighted milestones, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to be\\nemployed; and Specify tracking methodologies and the EVM computation equations for calculating projected estimate at\\ncompletion (EAC) forecasts to provide a validity check on the bottomup EAC.\\n Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various cost reports are defined.\\n Additional details. Additional details about cost management activities include but are not limited to:\\n Description of strategic funding choices, Procedure to account for fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and Procedure for project cost recording.\\n\\nFor more specific information regarding earned value management, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value\\nManagement  Second Edition [17].\\n\\n7.2 ESTIMATE COSTS\\n\\nEstimate Costs is the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete project\\nwork. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the monetary resources required for the project. This process\\nis performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process\\nare depicted in Figure 74. Figure 75 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n239\\nA cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required to complete the activity. It is a\\nprediction that is based on the information known at a given point in time. Cost estimates include the identification and\\nconsideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project. Cost tradeoffs and risks should be considered,\\nsuch as make versus buy, buy versus lease, and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project.\\n\\nCost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency (i.e., dollars, euros, yen, etc.), although in some\\ninstances other units of measure, such as staff hours or staff days, are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating the\\neffects of currency fluctuations.\\n\\nCost estimates should be reviewed and refined during the course of the project to reflect additional detail as it becomes\\navailable and assumptions are tested. The accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses through\\nthe project life cycle. For example, a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate\\nin the range of 25% to +75%. Later in the project, as more information is known, definitive estimates could narrow\\nthe range of accuracy to 5% to +10%. In some organizations, there are guidelines for when such refinements can beade and the degree of confidence or accuracy that is expected.\\n\\nCosts are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project. This includes but is not limited to labor,aterials, equipment, services, and facilities, as well as special categories such as an inflation allowance, cost of\\nfinancing, or contingency costs. Cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or in summary form.\\n\\n7.2.1 ESTIMATE COSTS: INPUTS\\n\\n7.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes estimating methods\\nthat can be used and the level of precision and accuracy required for the cost estimate.\\n\\n Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The quality management plan describes the activities\\nand resources necessary for the project management team to achieve the quality objectives set for the project.\\n\\n240 \\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,\\nand WBS dictionary:\\n Project scope statement. The scope statement (Section 5.3.3.1) reflects funding constraints by period for the\\nexpenditure of project funds or other financial assumptions and constraints.\\n Work breakdown structure. The WBS (Section 5.4.3.1) provides the relationships among all the project\\ndeliverables and their various components.\\n WBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary (Section 5.4.3.) and related detailed statements of work provide an\\nidentification of the deliverables and a description of the work in each WBS component required to produce\\neach deliverable.\\n\\n7.2.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to\\n\\ndeveloping cost estimates can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precision of\\nthe cost estimates.\\n\\n Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The schedule includes the type, quantity, and amount of time\\nthat team and physical resources will be active on the project. The duration estimates (Section 6.4.3.1) will\\naffect cost estimates when resources are charged per unit of time and when there are seasonal fluctuations\\nin costs. The schedule also provides useful information for projects that incorporate the cost of financing\\n(including interest charges).\\n\\n Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements identify the types and quantitiesf resources required for each work package or activity.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of individual project risks that\\nhave been identified and prioritized, and for which risk responses are required. The risk register provides detailed\\ninformation that can be used to estimate costs.\\n\\n241\\n7.2.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Market conditions. These conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the market,\\nfrom whom, and under what terms and conditions. Regional and/or global supply and demand conditions greatly\\ninfluence resource costs.\\n\\n Published commercial information. Resource cost rate information is often available from commercial\\ndatabases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.\\nPublished seller price lists are another source of information.\\n\\n Exchange rates and inflation. For largescale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the\\nfluctuations of currencies and inflation need to be understood and built into the Estimate Cost process.\\n\\n7.2.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:\\n Cost estimating policies,\\n Cost estimating templates,\\n\\n Historical information and lessons learned repository.\\n\\n7.2.2 ESTIMATE COSTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n7.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics:\\n\\n Previous similar projects;\\n Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; and\\n\\n Cost estimating methods.\\n\\n242 \\n7.2.2.2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.2. Analogous cost estimating uses values, or attributes, of a previous project that are\\nsimilar to the current project. Values and attributes of the projects may include but are not limited to: scope, cost, budget,\\nduration, and measures of scale (e.g., size, weight). Comparison of these project values, or attributes, becomes the basis\\nfor estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project.\\n\\n7.2.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.3. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical data\\nand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This technique can\\nproduce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. Parametric\\ncost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods.\\n\\n7.2.2.4 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.5. Bottomup estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The costf individual work packages or activities is estimated to the greatest level of specified detail. The detailed cost\\nis then summarized or “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost and\\naccuracy of bottomup cost estimating are typically influenced by the size or other attributes of the individual\\nactivity or work package.\\n\\n7.2.2.5 THREEPOINT ESTIMATING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.4. The accuracy of singlepoint cost estimates may be improved by considering estimation\\nuncertainty and risk and using three estimates to define an approximate range for an activity’s cost:\\n\\n Most likely (cM). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and any\\npredicted expenses.\\n\\n Optimistic (cO). The cost based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity.\\n\\n Pessimistic (cP). The cost based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.\\n\\n243\\nDepending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected cost, cE, can\\nbe calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The formulas are:\\n\\n Triangular distribution. cE (cO + cM + cP) / 3\\n Beta distribution. cE (CO + 4cM + cP) / 6\\n\\nCost estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected cost and clarify the range of\\nuncertainty around the expected cost.\\n\\n7.2.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS\\nData analysis techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is a technique used to evaluate identified options in order to select\\nwhich options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work of the project. An example would be\\nevaluating the cost, schedule, resource, and quality impacts of buying versus making a deliverable.\\n\\n Reserve analysis. Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances)\\nto account for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated for\\nidentified risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the known\\nunknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated, while\\nthe amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknown\\namount of rework. Contingency reserves can be provided at any level from the specific activity to the entire\\nproject. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated cost, a fixed number, or may be developed\\nby using quantitative analysis methods.\\n\\nAs more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced,r eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identified in cost documentation. Contingency reserves are part of\\nthe cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project.\\n\\n Cost of quality. Assumptions about costs of quality (Section 8.1.2.3) may be used to prepare the estimates. This\\nincludes evaluating the cost impact of additional investment in conformance versus the cost of nonconformance.\\nIt can also include looking at shortterm cost reductions versus the implication of more frequent problems latern in the product life cycle.\\n\\n244 \\n7.2.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. The project management information system can include spreadsheets, simulation\\nsoftware, and statistical analysis tools to assist with cost estimating. Such tools simplify the use of some costestimating\\ntechniques and thereby facilitate rapid consideration of cost estimate alternatives.\\n\\n7.2.2.8 DECISION MAKING\\n\\nThe decisionmaking techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to voting.\\nDescribed in Section 5.2.2.4, voting is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in\\nthe form of future actions. These techniques are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy and\\ncommitment to the emerging estimates.\\n\\n7.2.3 ESTIMATE COSTS: OUTPUTS\\n\\n7.2.3.1 COST ESTIMATES\\n\\nCost estimates include quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete project work, as well as\\ncontingency amounts to account for identified risks, and management reserve to cover unplanned work. Cost estimates\\ncan be presented in summary form or in detail. Costs are estimated for all resources that are applied to the cost\\nestimate. This includes but is not limited to direct labor, materials, equipment, services, facilities, information technology,\\nand special categories such as cost of financing (including interest charges), an inflation allowance, exchange rates,r a cost contingency reserve. Indirect costs, if they are included in the project estimate, can be included at the activity\\nlevel or at higher levels.\\n\\n245\\n7.2.3.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATES\\n\\nThe amount and type of additional details supporting the cost estimate vary by application area. Regardless of\\nthe level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the cost\\nestimate was derived.\\n\\nSupporting detail for cost estimates may include:\\n\\n Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed),\\n Documentation of all assumptions made,\\n\\n Documentation of any known constraints,\\n\\n Documentation of identified risks included when estimating costs,\\n\\n Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., US$10,000 (+10%) to indicate that the item is expected to\\ncost between a range of values), and\\n\\n Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate.\\n\\n7.2.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. During the Cost Estimates process, new assumptions may beade, new constraints may be identified, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed.\\nThe assumption log should be updated with this new information.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with\\ntechniques that were efficient and effective in developing cost estimates.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may be updated when appropriate risk responses\\nare chosen and agreed upon during the Estimate Cost process.\\n\\n7.3 DETERMINE BUDGET\\n\\nDetermine Budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to\\nestablish an authorized cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the cost baseline against\\nwhich project performance can be monitored and controlled. This process is performed once or at predefined points in\\nthe project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 76. Figure 77 depicts\\nthe data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\nA project budget includes all the funds authorized to execute the project. The cost baseline is the approved version of\\nthe timephased project budget that includes contingency reserves, but excludes management reserves.\\n\\n246 \\nProject\\ncharter\\n\\n247\\n7.3.1 DETERMINE BUDGET: INPUTS\\n\\n7.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes how the project\\ncosts will be structured into the project budget.\\n\\n Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan provides informationn rates (personnel and other resources), estimation of travel costs, and other foreseen costs that are necessary\\nto estimate the overall project budget.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,\\nand WBS dictionary details for cost estimation and management.\\n\\n7.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nExamples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Supporting detail for cost estimates contained in the basis for\\nestimates should specify any basic assumptions dealing with the inclusion or exclusion of indirect or other costs\\nin the project budget.\\n\\n Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates for each activity within a work package are\\naggregated to obtain a cost estimate for each work package.\\n\\n Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The project schedule includes planned start and finish dates\\nfor the project’s activities, milestones, work packages, and control accounts. This information can be used to\\naggregate costs to the calendar periods in which the costs are planned to be incurred.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register should be reviewed to consider how to aggregate\\nthe risk response costs. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates described in\\nSection 11.5.3.3.\\n\\n248 \\n7.3.1.3 BUSINE DOCUMENTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 1.2.6. The business documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but\\nare not limited to:\\n\\n Business case. The business case identifies the critical success factors for the project, including financial\\nsuccess factors.\\n\\n Benefits management plan. The benefits management plan includes the target benefits, such as net present\\nvalue calculations, timeframe for realizing benefits, and the metrics associated with the benefits.\\n7.3.1.4 AGREEMENTS\\nDescribed in Section 12.2.3.2. Applicable agreement information and costs relating to products, services, or results\\nthat have been or will be purchased are included when determining the budget.\\n7.3.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited\\nto exchange rates. For largescale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the fluctuations of\\ncurrencies need to be understood and built into the Determine Budget process.\\n\\n7.3.1.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Determine Budget process include but are not limited to:\\n Existing formal and informal cost budgetingrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines;\\n\\n Historical information and lessons learned repository.\\n\\n Cost budgeting tools; and\\n\\n Reporting methods.\\n\\n249\\n7.3.2 DETERMINE BUDGET: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n7.3.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics:\\n\\n Previous similar projects;\\n Information in the industry, discipline, and application area;\\n Financial principles; and\\n\\n Funding requirement and sources.\\n\\n7.3.2.2 COST AGGREGATION\\n\\nCost estimates are aggregated by work packages in accordance with the WBS. The work package cost estimates\\nare then aggregated for the higher component levels of the WBS (such as control accounts) and, ultimately, for the\\nentire project.\\n\\n7.3.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nA data analysis technique that can be used in the Determine Budget process includes but is not limited to reserve\\nanalysis, which can establish the management reserves for the project. Management reserves are an amount of\\nthe project budget withheld for management control purposes and are reserved for unforeseen work that is within\\nscope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address the unknown unknowns that can affect a project.\\nThe management reserve is not included in the cost baseline but is part of the overall project budget and funding\\nrequirements. When an amount of management reserves is used to fund unforeseen work, the amount of management\\nreserve used is added to the cost baseline, thus requiring an approved change to the cost baseline.\\n\\n250 \\n7.3.2.4 HISTORICAL INFORMATION REVIEW\\n\\nReviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates. Historical\\ninformation may include project characteristics (parameters) to develop mathematical models to predict total project\\ncosts. Such models may be simple (e.g., residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space)r complex (e.g., one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors, each of which\\nhas numerous points within it).\\n\\nBoth the cost and accuracy of analogous and parametric models can vary widely. They are most likely to be\\nreliable when:\\n\\n Historical information used to develop the model is accurate,\\n Parameters used in the model are readily quantifiable, and\\n\\n Models are scalable, such that they work for large projects, small projects, and phases of a project.\\n\\n7.3.2.5 FUNDING LIMIT RECONCILIATION\\n\\nThe expenditure of funds should be reconciled with any funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project.\\nA variance between the funding limits and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the rescheduling of\\nwork to level out the rate of expenditures. This is accomplished by placing imposed date constraints for work into\\nthe project schedule.\\n\\n7.3.2.6 FINANCING\\n\\nFinancing entails acquiring funding for projects. It is common for longterm infrastructure, industrial, and public\\nservices projects to seek external sources of funds. If a project is funded externally, the funding entity may have certain\\nrequirements that are required to be met.\\n\\n251\\n7.3.3 DETERMINE BUDGET: OUTPUTS\\n\\n7.3.3.1 COST BASELINE\\n\\nThe cost baseline is the approved version of the timephased project budget, excluding any management reserves,\\nwhich can only be changed through formal change control procedures. It is used as a basis for comparison to actual\\nresults. The cost baseline is developed as a summation of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities.\\n\\nFigure 78 illustrates the various components of the project budget and cost baseline. Cost estimates for tie va.ious\\nproject activities, along with any contingency reserves (see Section 7.2.2.6) for these activities, are oox,egated\\ninto their associated work package costs. The work package cost estimates, along with any corusec.y reserves\\nestimated for the work packages, are aggregated into control accounts. The summation of 1.2 ec:trol accountsake up the cost baseline. Since the cost estimates that make up the cost baseline are dire cly ticd to the schedule\\nactivities, this enables a timephased view of the cost baseline, which is typically displaye4 1. tie form of an Scurve,\\nas is illustrated in Figure 79. For projects that use earned value management, the ccst Jas «tine is referred to as the\\nperformance measurement baseline.\\n\\nManagement reserves (Section 7.2.2.3) are added to the cost baseline to droduce the project budget. As changes\\nwarranting the use of management reserves arise, the change control preccss ‘s used to obtain approval to move the\\napplicable management reserve funds into the cost baseline.\\n\\n252 \\n253\\n7.3.3.2 PROJECT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS\\n\\nTotal funding requirements and periodic funding requirements (e.g., quarterly, annually) are derived from the cost\\nbaseline. The cost baseline will include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities. Funding often occurs in\\nincremental amounts, and may not be evenly distributed, which appear as steps in Figure 79. The total funds required\\nare those included in the cost baseline plus management reserves, if any. Funding requirements may include the\\nsource(s) of the funding.\\n\\n7.3.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not !.7ic to:\\n Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates are updated to record any a idit. onal information.\\n\\n Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Estimated costs for each activity ma, 1. corded as part of the\\nproject schedule.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks identified durine thi. nrucess are recorded in the risk\\nregister and managed using the risk management processes.\\n\\n7.4 CONTROL COSTS\\n\\nControl Costs is the process of monitoring the status of the projec’. .. update the project costs and managing changes\\nto the cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the cos‘ Luseline is maintained throughout the project. This\\nprocess is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tcsls aid cechniques, and outputs of this process are depicted\\nin Figure 710. Figure 711 depicts the data flow diagram ef cne process.\\n\\n254 \\nProject\\ncharter\\n\\n255\\nUpdating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date. Any increase to the authorized budget cannly be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Monitoring the expenditure of\\nfunds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project, other\\nthan to track the outflow of funds. Much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between the\\nconsumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures. The key to effective cost control\\nis the management of the approved cost baseline.\\n\\nProject cost control includes:\\n\\n Influencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline;\\n Ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner;\\n\\n Managing the actual changes when and as they occur;\\n\\n Ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period, by WBS component, by activity,\\nand in total for the project;\\n\\n Monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved cost baseline;\\n Monitoring work performance against funds expended;\\n\\n Preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource usage;\\n\\n Informing appropriate stakeholders of all approved changes and associated cost; and\\n\\n Bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits.\\n\\n7.4.1 CONTROL COSTS: INPUTS\\n\\n7.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes how the project\\ncosts will be managed and controlled.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline is compared with actual results to determine if a\\nchange, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary.\\n\\n Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis, the\\nperformance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or\\npreventive action is necessary.\\n\\n256 \\n7.4.1.2. PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\n\\nExamples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to the\\nlessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to later\\nphases in the project to improve cost control.\\n\\n7.4.1.3 PROJECT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 7.3.3.2. The project funding requirements include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities.\\n\\n7.4.1.4 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which costs have been\\nauthorized, incurred, invoiced, and paid.\\n\\n7.4.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Control Costs process include but are not limited to:\\n Existing formal and informal cost controlrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines;\\n Cost control tools; and\\n\\n Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.\\n\\n7.4.2 CONTROL COSTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n7.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Examples of expert judgment during the Control Costs process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Variance analysis,\\n Earned value analysis,\\n Forecasting, and\\n\\n Financial analysis.\\n\\n257\\n7.4.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used to control costs include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Earned value analysis (EVA). Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to the\\n\\nactual schedule and cost performance. EVM integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule\\nbaseline to form the performance measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors three key dimensions for\\neach work package and control account:\\n Planned value. Planned value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the authorized\\nbudget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure (WBS) component,\\nnot including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a given\\npoint in time, planned value defines the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of the\\nPY is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total planned value for the\\nproject is also known as budget at completion (BAC).\\n Earned value. Earned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized\\nfor that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The EV beingeasured needs to be related to the PMB, and the EV measured cannot be greater than the authorized\\nPV budget for a component. The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progresseasurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Projectanagers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the long\\nterm performance trends.\\n\\nActual cost. Actual cost (AC) is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a\\nspecific time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The AC\\nneeds to correspond in definition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., direct hoursnly, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spent\\nto achieve the EV will be measured.\\n\\n258\\n\\n\\n Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis, as used in EVM, is the explanation (cause,\\nimpact, and corrective actions) for cost (CV EV  AC), schedule (SV EV  PV), and variance at completion\\n(VAC BAC  EAC) variances. Cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements.\\nFor projects not using formal earned value analysis, similar variance analyses can be performed by comparing\\nplanned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance.\\nFurther analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedule\\nbaseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed. Cost performance measurements are used to assess\\nthe magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline. An important aspect of project cost control includes\\ndetermining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline (see Section 7.3.3.1) and deciding\\nwhether corrective or preventive action is required. The percentage range of acceptable variances will tend to\\ndecrease as more work is accomplished. Examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to:\\n Schedule variance. Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference\\nbetween the earned value and the planned value. It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behind\\nthe planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on a project. It\\nis equal to the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The EVA schedule variance is a useful metric\\nin that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. The EVA schedule\\nvariance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will have\\nbeen earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method (CPM) scheduling and\\nrisk management. Equation: SV EV  PV.\\n\\nCost variance. Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget deficit or surplus at a given point in time, expressed\\nas the difference between earned value and the actual cost. It isa measure of cost performance on a project.\\nIt is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC). The cost variance at the end of the project will\\nbe the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the actual amount spent. The CV is particularly\\ncritical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative CV is often\\ndifficult for the project to recover. Equation: CV EV  AC.\\n\\n259 Schedule performance index. The schedule performance index (SPI) is a measure of schedule efficiency\\n\\nexpressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value. It measures how efficiently the project team is\\naccomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index (CPI) to forecast\\nthe final project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed than\\nwas planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since the\\nSPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine\\nwhether the project will finish ahead of or behind its planned finish date. The SPI is equal to the ratio of the\\nEV to the PV. Equation: SPI EV/PV.\\n\\nCost performance index. The cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost efficiency of budgeted\\nresources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVA metric\\nand measures the cost efficiency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrun\\nfor work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The CPI is\\nequal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: CPI EV/AC.\\n\\n Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine\\n\\nif performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding\\nperformance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of BAC versus estimate at\\ncompletion (EAC) and completion dates. Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to:\\n\\nCharts. In earned value analysis, three parameters of planned value, earned value, and actual cost can benitored and reported on both a periodbyperiod basis (typically weekly or monthly) and on a cumulative\\nbasis. Figure 712 uses Scurves to display EV data for a project that is performing over budget and behind\\nthe schedule.\\n\\n260\\n\\n Forecasting. As the project progresses, the project team may develop a forecast for the estimate at completion\\n(EAC) that may differ from the budget at completion (BAC) based on the project performance. If it becomesbvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Forecasting\\nthe EAC involves making projections of conditions and events in the project’s future based on current\\nperformance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are generated,\\nupdated, and reissued based on work performance data (Section 4.3.3.2) that is provided as the project is\\nexecuted. The work performance information covers the project’s past performance and any information that\\ncould impact the project in the future.\\n\\nEACs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed, plus an estimate to complete (ETC)\\nthe remaining work. It is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the ETC,\\nbased on its experience to date. Earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of the\\nrequired EAC costs. The most common EAC forecasting approach is a manual, bottomup summation by the\\nproject manager and project team.\\n\\nThe project manager’s bottomup EAC method builds upon the actual costs and experience incurred for\\nthe work completed, and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. Equation: EAC =\\nAC + Bottomup ETC.\\n\\n261\\nThe project manager’s manual EAC is quickly compared with a range of calculated EACs representing\\nvarious risk scenarios. When calculating EAC values, the cumulative CPI and SPI values are typically\\nused. While EVM data quickly provide many statistical EACs, only three of the more common methods are\\ndescribed as follows:\\n EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted rate. This EAC method accepts the actual project\\nperformance to date (whether favorable or unfavorable) as represented by the actual costs, and predicts\\nthat all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. When actual performance is unfavorable,\\nthe assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when supported by project\\nrisk analysis. Equation: EAC AC + (BAC  EV).\\n. EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present CPI. This method assumes that what the project has\\nexperienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. The ETC work is assumed to be performed\\nat the same cumulative cost performance index (CPI) as that incurred by the project to date. Equation:\\nEAC BAC / CPI.\\n EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI factors. In this forecast, the ETC work will be\\nperformed at an efficiency rate that considers both the cost and schedule performance indices. Thisethod is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort. Variations of thisethod weight the CPI and SPI at different values (e.g., 80/20, 50/50, or some other ratio) according to\\nthe project manager’s judgment. Equation: EAC AC + [(BAC  EV) / (CPI x SPI)].\\n\\n Reserve analysis. Described in Section 7.2.2.6. During cost control, reserve analysis is used to monitor the\\n\\nstatus of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed or\\nif additional reserves need to be requested. As work on the project progresses, these reserves may be used as\\nplanned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. Conversely, when opportunities are captured\\nand resulting in cost savings, funds may be added to the contingency amount, or taken from the project asargin/profit.\\n\\nIf the identified risks do not occur, the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget to\\nfree up resources for other projects or operations. Additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a need\\nto request that additional reserves be added to the project budget.\\n\\n262\\n\\n\\n7.4.2.3 TOCOMPLETE PERFORMANCE INDEX\\n\\nThe tocomplete performance index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved with\\nthe remaining resources in order to meet a specified management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish\\nthe outstanding work to the remaining budget. TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved on the\\nremaining work to meet a specified management goal, such as the BAC or the EAC. If it becomes obvious that the BAC\\nis no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace che\\nBAC in the TCPI calculation. The equation for the TCP! based on the BAC: (BAC  EV) / (BAC  AC).\\n\\nThe TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 713. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower left a. th: work\\nremaining (defined as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which can be either ti.e CAC ininus the\\nAC, or the EAC minus the AC).\\n\\nIf the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 713), all future work of .5 project will need\\nto be performed immediately in the range of the TCPI (BAC) (as reflected in the top ‘ine o: Figure 713) to stay\\nwithin the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgriet atl based on a number of\\nconsiderations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and technical pe.tor nate. This level of performance\\nis displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for the TCPI is based on the EAx: (BAC  EV) / (EAC  AC). The EVM\\nformulas are provided in Table 71.\\n\\n263\\n264 \\n7.4.2.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems are often used to monitor the three EVM\\ndimensions (PV, EV, and AC), to display graphical trends, and to forecast a range of possible final project results.\\n\\n7.4.3 CONTROL COSTS: OUTPUTS\\n\\n7.4.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work is\\nperforming compared to the cost baseline. Variances in the work performed and the cost of the work are evaluated at\\nthe work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, CV, CPI, EAC, VAC, and TCPI\\nare documented for inclusion in work performance reports (Section 4.5.3.1).\\n\\n265\\n7.4.3.2 COST FORECASTS\\n\\nEither a calculated EAC value or a bottomup EAC value is documented and communicated to stakeholders.\\n\\n7.4.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Analysis of project performance may result in a change request to the cost and\\nschedule baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for review\\nand disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).\\n\\n7.4.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change\\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. Changes to the cost management plan, such as changes\\nto control thresholds or specified levels of accuracy required in managing the project’s cost, are incorporated in\\nresponse to feedback from relevant stakeholders.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to\\napproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a\\nrevised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.\\n\\n Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement\\nbaseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.\\nIn some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the\\nperformance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.\\n\\n266 \\n7.4.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n Assumption log.

      "['1 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT\\n\\nPlan Cost Management is the process of defining how the project costs will be estimated, budgeted, managed,onitored, and controlled. The key benefit of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how the project\\ncosts will be managed throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. The\\ninputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 72. Figure 73 depicts the data flow\\ndiagram of the process.\\n\\n235\\nThe cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework for each of the costanagement processes so that performance of the processes will be efficient and coordinated. The cost management\\nprocesses and their associated tools and techniques are documented in the cost management plan. The cost management\\nplan is a component of the project management plan.\\n\\n7.1.1 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: INPUTS\\n\\n7.1.1.1. PROJECT CHARTER\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. The project charter provides the preapproved financial resources from which the detailed\\nproject costs are developed. The project charter also defines the project approval requirements that will influence theanagement of the project costs.\\n\\n7.1.1.2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan establishes the\\ncriteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule management\\nplan provides processes and controls that will impact cost estimation and management.\\n\\n Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides the approach for\\nidentifying, analyzing, and monitoring risks. The risk management plan provides processes and controls that will\\nimpact cost estimation and management.\\n\\n7.1.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Cost Management process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Organizational culture and structure can influence cost management.\\n Market conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the regional and global markets.\\n\\n Currency exchange rates for project costs are sourced from more than one country.\\n\\n236 \\n Published commercial information such as resource cost rate information is often available from commercial\\ndatabases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.\\nPublished seller price lists are another source of information.\\n\\n Project management information system provides alternative possibilities for managing cost.\\n\\n Productivity differences in different parts of the world can have a large influence on the cost of projects.\\n\\n7.1.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Cost Management process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Financial controls procedures (e.g., time reporting, required expenditure and disbursement reviews, accounting\\ncodes, and standard contract provisions);\\n\\n Historical information and lessons learned repository;\\n Financial databases; and\\n\\n Existing formal and informal cost estimating and budgetingrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines.\\n\\n7.1.2 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n7.1.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics:\\n\\n Previous similar projects;\\n Information in the industry, discipline, and application area;\\n Cost estimating and budgeting; and\\n\\n Earned value management.\\n\\n237\\n7.1.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nA data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.\\nAlternatives analysis can include reviewing strategic funding options such as: selffunding, funding with equity, or\\nfunding with debt. It can also include consideration of ways to acquire project resources such as making, purchasing,\\nrenting, or leasing.\\n\\n7.1.2.3 MEETINGS\\n\\nProject teams may hold planning meetings to develop the cost management plan. Attendees may include the projectanager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility for\\nproject costs, and others as needed.\\n\\n7.1.3 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS\\n\\n7.1.3.1. COST MANAGEMENT PLAN\\n\\nThe cost management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how the project costs will\\nbe planned, structured, and controlled. The cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques are\\ndocumented in the cost management plan.\\n\\nFor example, the cost management plan can establish the following:\\n\\n Units of measure. Each unit used in measurements (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures;eters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures; or lump sum in currency form) is defined\\nfor each of the resources.\\n\\n Level of precision. This is the degree to which cost estimates will be rounded up or down (e.g., US$995.59 to\\nUS$1,000), based on the scope of the activities and magnitude of the project.\\n\\n Level of accuracy. The acceptable range (e.g., +10%) used in determining realistic cost estimates is specified,\\nand may include an amount for contingencies.\\n\\n238 \\n Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides the\\nframework for the cost management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates, budgets, and controlf costs. The WBS component used for the project cost accounting is called the control account. Each\\ncontrol account is assigned a unique code or account number(s) that links directly to the performingrganization’s accounting system.\\n\\n Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be specified to indicate an\\nagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typically\\nexpressed as percentage deviations from the baseline plan.\\n\\n Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules of performance measurement are\\nset. For example, the cost management plan may: Define the points in the WBS at which measurement of control accounts will be performed; Establish the EVM techniques (e.g., weighted milestones, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to be\\nemployed; and Specify tracking methodologies and the EVM computation equations for calculating projected estimate at\\ncompletion (EAC) forecasts to provide a validity check on the bottomup EAC.\\n Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various cost reports are defined.\\n Additional details. Additional details about cost management activities include but are not limited to:\\n Description of strategic funding choices, Procedure to account for fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and Procedure for project cost recording.\\n\\nFor more specific information regarding earned value management, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned Value\\nManagement  Second Edition [17].\\n\\n7.2 ESTIMATE COSTS\\n\\nEstimate Costs is the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete project\\nwork. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the monetary resources required for the project. This process\\nis performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process\\nare depicted in Figure 74. Figure 75 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\n239\\nA cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required to complete the activity. It is a\\nprediction that is based on the information known at a given point in time. Cost estimates include the identification and\\nconsideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project. Cost tradeoffs and risks should be considered,\\nsuch as make versus buy, buy versus lease, and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project.\\n\\nCost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency (i.e., dollars, euros, yen, etc.), although in some\\ninstances other units of measure, such as staff hours or staff days, are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating the\\neffects of currency fluctuations.\\n\\nCost estimates should be reviewed and refined during the course of the project to reflect additional detail as it becomes\\navailable and assumptions are tested. The accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses through\\nthe project life cycle. For example, a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimate\\nin the range of 25% to +75%. Later in the project, as more information is known, definitive estimates could narrow\\nthe range of accuracy to 5% to +10%. In some organizations, there are guidelines for when such refinements can beade and the degree of confidence or accuracy that is expected.\\n\\nCosts are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project. This includes but is not limited to labor,aterials, equipment, services, and facilities, as well as special categories such as an inflation allowance, cost of\\nfinancing, or contingency costs. Cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or in summary form.\\n\\n7.2.1 ESTIMATE COSTS: INPUTS\\n\\n7.2.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes estimating methods\\nthat can be used and the level of precision and accuracy required for the cost estimate.\\n\\n Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The quality management plan describes the activities\\nand resources necessary for the project management team to achieve the quality objectives set for the project.\\n\\n240 \\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,\\nand WBS dictionary:\\n Project scope statement. The scope statement (Section 5.3.3.1) reflects funding constraints by period for the\\nexpenditure of project funds or other financial assumptions and constraints.\\n Work breakdown structure. The WBS (Section 5.4.3.1) provides the relationships among all the project\\ndeliverables and their various components.\\n WBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary (Section 5.4.3.) and related detailed statements of work provide an\\nidentification of the deliverables and a description of the work in each WBS component required to produce\\neach deliverable.\\n\\n7.2.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard to\\n\\ndeveloping cost estimates can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precision of\\nthe cost estimates.\\n\\n Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The schedule includes the type, quantity, and amount of time\\nthat team and physical resources will be active on the project. The duration estimates (Section 6.4.3.1) will\\naffect cost estimates when resources are charged per unit of time and when there are seasonal fluctuations\\nin costs. The schedule also provides useful information for projects that incorporate the cost of financing\\n(including interest charges).\\n\\n Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements identify the types and quantitiesf resources required for each work package or activity.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of individual project risks that\\nhave been identified and prioritized, and for which risk responses are required. The risk register provides detailed\\ninformation that can be used to estimate costs.\\n\\n241\\n7.2.1.3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Market conditions. These conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the market,\\nfrom whom, and under what terms and conditions. Regional and/or global supply and demand conditions greatly\\ninfluence resource costs.\\n\\n Published commercial information. Resource cost rate information is often available from commercial\\ndatabases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.\\nPublished seller price lists are another source of information.\\n\\n Exchange rates and inflation. For largescale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the\\nfluctuations of currencies and inflation need to be understood and built into the Estimate Cost process.\\n\\n7.2.1.4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:\\n Cost estimating policies,\\n Cost estimating templates,\\n\\n Historical information and lessons learned repository.\\n\\n7.2.2 ESTIMATE COSTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n7.2.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics:\\n\\n Previous similar projects;\\n Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; and\\n\\n Cost estimating methods.\\n\\n242 \\n7.2.2.2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.2. Analogous cost estimating uses values, or attributes, of a previous project that are\\nsimilar to the current project. Values and attributes of the projects may include but are not limited to: scope, cost, budget,\\nduration, and measures of scale (e.g., size, weight). Comparison of these project values, or attributes, becomes the basis\\nfor estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project.\\n\\n7.2.2.3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.3. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical data\\nand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This technique can\\nproduce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. Parametric\\ncost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods.\\n\\n7.2.2.4 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.5. Bottomup estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The costf individual work packages or activities is estimated to the greatest level of specified detail. The detailed cost\\nis then summarized or “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost and\\naccuracy of bottomup cost estimating are typically influenced by the size or other attributes of the individual\\nactivity or work package.\\n\\n7.2.2.5 THREEPOINT ESTIMATING\\n\\nDescribed in Section 6.4.2.4. The accuracy of singlepoint cost estimates may be improved by considering estimation\\nuncertainty and risk and using three estimates to define an approximate range for an activity’s cost:\\n\\n Most likely (cM). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and any\\npredicted expenses.\\n\\n Optimistic (cO). The cost based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity.\\n\\n Pessimistic (cP). The cost based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.\\n\\n243\\nDepending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected cost, cE, can\\nbe calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The formulas are:\\n\\n Triangular distribution. cE (cO + cM + cP) / 3\\n Beta distribution. cE (CO + 4cM + cP) / 6\\n\\nCost estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected cost and clarify the range of\\nuncertainty around the expected cost.\\n\\n7.2.2.6 DATA ANALYSIS\\nData analysis techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is a technique used to evaluate identified options in order to select\\nwhich options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work of the project. An example would be\\nevaluating the cost, schedule, resource, and quality impacts of buying versus making a deliverable.\\n\\n Reserve analysis. Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances)\\nto account for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated for\\nidentified risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the known\\nunknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated, while\\nthe amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknown\\namount of rework. Contingency reserves can be provided at any level from the specific activity to the entire\\nproject. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated cost, a fixed number, or may be developed\\nby using quantitative analysis methods.\\n\\nAs more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced,r eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identified in cost documentation. Contingency reserves are part of\\nthe cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project.\\n\\n Cost of quality. Assumptions about costs of quality (Section 8.1.2.3) may be used to prepare the estimates. This\\nincludes evaluating the cost impact of additional investment in conformance versus the cost of nonconformance.\\nIt can also include looking at shortterm cost reductions versus the implication of more frequent problems latern in the product life cycle.\\n\\n244 \\n7.2.2.7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. The project management information system can include spreadsheets, simulation\\nsoftware, and statistical analysis tools to assist with cost estimating. Such tools simplify the use of some costestimating\\ntechniques and thereby facilitate rapid consideration of cost estimate alternatives.\\n\\n7.2.2.8 DECISION MAKING\\n\\nThe decisionmaking techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to voting.\\nDescribed in Section 5.2.2.4, voting is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in\\nthe form of future actions. These techniques are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy and\\ncommitment to the emerging estimates.\\n\\n7.2.3 ESTIMATE COSTS: OUTPUTS\\n\\n7.2.3.1 COST ESTIMATES\\n\\nCost estimates include quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete project work, as well as\\ncontingency amounts to account for identified risks, and management reserve to cover unplanned work. Cost estimates\\ncan be presented in summary form or in detail. Costs are estimated for all resources that are applied to the cost\\nestimate. This includes but is not limited to direct labor, materials, equipment, services, facilities, information technology,\\nand special categories such as cost of financing (including interest charges), an inflation allowance, exchange rates,r a cost contingency reserve. Indirect costs, if they are included in the project estimate, can be included at the activity\\nlevel or at higher levels.\\n\\n245\\n7.2.3.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATES\\n\\nThe amount and type of additional details supporting the cost estimate vary by application area. Regardless of\\nthe level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the cost\\nestimate was derived.\\n\\nSupporting detail for cost estimates may include:\\n\\n Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed),\\n Documentation of all assumptions made,\\n\\n Documentation of any known constraints,\\n\\n Documentation of identified risks included when estimating costs,\\n\\n Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., US$10,000 (+10%) to indicate that the item is expected to\\ncost between a range of values), and\\n\\n Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate.\\n\\n7.2.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. During the Cost Estimates process, new assumptions may beade, new constraints may be identified, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed.\\nThe assumption log should be updated with this new information.\\n\\n Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated with\\ntechniques that were efficient and effective in developing cost estimates.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may be updated when appropriate risk responses\\nare chosen and agreed upon during the Estimate Cost process.\\n\\n7.3 DETERMINE BUDGET\\n\\nDetermine Budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages to\\nestablish an authorized cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the cost baseline against\\nwhich project performance can be monitored and controlled. This process is performed once or at predefined points in\\nthe project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 76. Figure 77 depicts\\nthe data flow diagram of the process.\\n\\nA project budget includes all the funds authorized to execute the project. The cost baseline is the approved version of\\nthe timephased project budget that includes contingency reserves, but excludes management reserves.\\n\\n246 \\nProject\\ncharter\\n\\n247\\n7.3.1 DETERMINE BUDGET: INPUTS\\n\\n7.3.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes how the project\\ncosts will be structured into the project budget.\\n\\n Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan provides informationn rates (personnel and other resources), estimation of travel costs, and other foreseen costs that are necessary\\nto estimate the overall project budget.\\n\\n Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,\\nand WBS dictionary details for cost estimation and management.\\n\\n7.3.1.2 PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\nExamples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Supporting detail for cost estimates contained in the basis for\\nestimates should specify any basic assumptions dealing with the inclusion or exclusion of indirect or other costs\\nin the project budget.\\n\\n Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates for each activity within a work package are\\naggregated to obtain a cost estimate for each work package.\\n\\n Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The project schedule includes planned start and finish dates\\nfor the project’s activities, milestones, work packages, and control accounts. This information can be used to\\naggregate costs to the calendar periods in which the costs are planned to be incurred.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register should be reviewed to consider how to aggregate\\nthe risk response costs. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates described in\\nSection 11.5.3.3.\\n\\n248 \\n7.3.1.3 BUSINE DOCUMENTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 1.2.6. The business documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but\\nare not limited to:\\n\\n Business case. The business case identifies the critical success factors for the project, including financial\\nsuccess factors.\\n\\n Benefits management plan. The benefits management plan includes the target benefits, such as net present\\nvalue calculations, timeframe for realizing benefits, and the metrics associated with the benefits.\\n7.3.1.4 AGREEMENTS\\nDescribed in Section 12.2.3.2. Applicable agreement information and costs relating to products, services, or results\\nthat have been or will be purchased are included when determining the budget.\\n7.3.1.5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS\\n\\nThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited\\nto exchange rates. For largescale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the fluctuations of\\ncurrencies need to be understood and built into the Determine Budget process.\\n\\n7.3.1.6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\n\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Determine Budget process include but are not limited to:\\n Existing formal and informal cost budgetingrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines;\\n\\n Historical information and lessons learned repository.\\n\\n Cost budgeting tools; and\\n\\n Reporting methods.\\n\\n249\\n7.3.2 DETERMINE BUDGET: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n7.3.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics:\\n\\n Previous similar projects;\\n Information in the industry, discipline, and application area;\\n Financial principles; and\\n\\n Funding requirement and sources.\\n\\n7.3.2.2 COST AGGREGATION\\n\\nCost estimates are aggregated by work packages in accordance with the WBS. The work package cost estimates\\nare then aggregated for the higher component levels of the WBS (such as control accounts) and, ultimately, for the\\nentire project.\\n\\n7.3.2.3 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nA data analysis technique that can be used in the Determine Budget process includes but is not limited to reserve\\nanalysis, which can establish the management reserves for the project. Management reserves are an amount of\\nthe project budget withheld for management control purposes and are reserved for unforeseen work that is within\\nscope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address the unknown unknowns that can affect a project.\\nThe management reserve is not included in the cost baseline but is part of the overall project budget and funding\\nrequirements. When an amount of management reserves is used to fund unforeseen work, the amount of management\\nreserve used is added to the cost baseline, thus requiring an approved change to the cost baseline.\\n\\n250 \\n7.3.2.4 HISTORICAL INFORMATION REVIEW\\n\\nReviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates. Historical\\ninformation may include project characteristics (parameters) to develop mathematical models to predict total project\\ncosts. Such models may be simple (e.g., residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space)r complex (e.g., one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors, each of which\\nhas numerous points within it).\\n\\nBoth the cost and accuracy of analogous and parametric models can vary widely. They are most likely to be\\nreliable when:\\n\\n Historical information used to develop the model is accurate,\\n Parameters used in the model are readily quantifiable, and\\n\\n Models are scalable, such that they work for large projects, small projects, and phases of a project.\\n\\n7.3.2.5 FUNDING LIMIT RECONCILIATION\\n\\nThe expenditure of funds should be reconciled with any funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project.\\nA variance between the funding limits and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the rescheduling of\\nwork to level out the rate of expenditures. This is accomplished by placing imposed date constraints for work into\\nthe project schedule.\\n\\n7.3.2.6 FINANCING\\n\\nFinancing entails acquiring funding for projects. It is common for longterm infrastructure, industrial, and public\\nservices projects to seek external sources of funds. If a project is funded externally, the funding entity may have certain\\nrequirements that are required to be met.\\n\\n251\\n7.3.3 DETERMINE BUDGET: OUTPUTS\\n\\n7.3.3.1 COST BASELINE\\n\\nThe cost baseline is the approved version of the timephased project budget, excluding any management reserves,\\nwhich can only be changed through formal change control procedures. It is used as a basis for comparison to actual\\nresults. The cost baseline is developed as a summation of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities.\\n\\nFigure 78 illustrates the various components of the project budget and cost baseline. Cost estimates for tie va.ious\\nproject activities, along with any contingency reserves (see Section 7.2.2.6) for these activities, are oox,egated\\ninto their associated work package costs. The work package cost estimates, along with any corusec.y reserves\\nestimated for the work packages, are aggregated into control accounts. The summation of 1.2 ec:trol accountsake up the cost baseline. Since the cost estimates that make up the cost baseline are dire cly ticd to the schedule\\nactivities, this enables a timephased view of the cost baseline, which is typically displaye4 1. tie form of an Scurve,\\nas is illustrated in Figure 79. For projects that use earned value management, the ccst Jas «tine is referred to as the\\nperformance measurement baseline.\\n\\nManagement reserves (Section 7.2.2.3) are added to the cost baseline to droduce the project budget. As changes\\nwarranting the use of management reserves arise, the change control preccss ‘s used to obtain approval to move the\\napplicable management reserve funds into the cost baseline.\\n\\n252 \\n253\\n7.3.3.2 PROJECT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS\\n\\nTotal funding requirements and periodic funding requirements (e.g., quarterly, annually) are derived from the cost\\nbaseline. The cost baseline will include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities. Funding often occurs in\\nincremental amounts, and may not be evenly distributed, which appear as steps in Figure 79. The total funds required\\nare those included in the cost baseline plus management reserves, if any. Funding requirements may include the\\nsource(s) of the funding.\\n\\n7.3.3.3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not !.7ic to:\\n Cost estimates. Described in Section 7.2.3.1. Cost estimates are updated to record any a idit. onal information.\\n\\n Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Estimated costs for each activity ma, 1. corded as part of the\\nproject schedule.\\n\\n Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks identified durine thi. nrucess are recorded in the risk\\nregister and managed using the risk management processes.\\n\\n7.4 CONTROL COSTS\\n\\nControl Costs is the process of monitoring the status of the projec’. .. update the project costs and managing changes\\nto the cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the cos‘ Luseline is maintained throughout the project. This\\nprocess is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tcsls aid cechniques, and outputs of this process are depicted\\nin Figure 710. Figure 711 depicts the data flow diagram ef cne process.\\n\\n254 \\nProject\\ncharter\\n\\n255\\nUpdating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date. Any increase to the authorized budget cannly be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Monitoring the expenditure of\\nfunds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project, other\\nthan to track the outflow of funds. Much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between the\\nconsumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures. The key to effective cost control\\nis the management of the approved cost baseline.\\n\\nProject cost control includes:\\n\\n Influencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline;\\n Ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner;\\n\\n Managing the actual changes when and as they occur;\\n\\n Ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period, by WBS component, by activity,\\nand in total for the project;\\n\\n Monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved cost baseline;\\n Monitoring work performance against funds expended;\\n\\n Preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource usage;\\n\\n Informing appropriate stakeholders of all approved changes and associated cost; and\\n\\n Bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits.\\n\\n7.4.1 CONTROL COSTS: INPUTS\\n\\n7.4.1.1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN\\nDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. The cost management plan describes how the project\\ncosts will be managed and controlled.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. The cost baseline is compared with actual results to determine if a\\nchange, corrective action, or preventive action is necessary.\\n\\n Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. When using earned value analysis, the\\nperformance measurement baseline is compared to actual results to determine if a change, corrective action, or\\npreventive action is necessary.\\n\\n256 \\n7.4.1.2. PROJECT DOCUMENTS\\n\\nExamples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to the\\nlessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to later\\nphases in the project to improve cost control.\\n\\n7.4.1.3 PROJECT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 7.3.3.2. The project funding requirements include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities.\\n\\n7.4.1.4 WORK PERFORMANCE DATA\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which costs have been\\nauthorized, incurred, invoiced, and paid.\\n\\n7.4.1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETS\\nThe organizational process assets that can influence the Control Costs process include but are not limited to:\\n Existing formal and informal cost controlrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines;\\n Cost control tools; and\\n\\n Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.\\n\\n7.4.2 CONTROL COSTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES\\n\\n7.4.2.1 EXPERT JUDGMENT\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Examples of expert judgment during the Control Costs process include but are not\\nlimited to:\\n\\n Variance analysis,\\n Earned value analysis,\\n Forecasting, and\\n\\n Financial analysis.\\n\\n257\\n7.4.2.2 DATA ANALYSIS\\n\\nData analysis techniques that can be used to control costs include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Earned value analysis (EVA). Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to the\\n\\nactual schedule and cost performance. EVM integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedule\\nbaseline to form the performance measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors three key dimensions for\\neach work package and control account:\\n Planned value. Planned value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the authorized\\nbudget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure (WBS) component,\\nnot including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a given\\npoint in time, planned value defines the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of the\\nPY is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total planned value for the\\nproject is also known as budget at completion (BAC).\\n Earned value. Earned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized\\nfor that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The EV beingeasured needs to be related to the PMB, and the EV measured cannot be greater than the authorized\\nPV budget for a component. The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progresseasurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Projectanagers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the long\\nterm performance trends.\\n\\nActual cost. Actual cost (AC) is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a\\nspecific time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The AC\\nneeds to correspond in definition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., direct hoursnly, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spent\\nto achieve the EV will be measured.\\n\\n258\\n\\n\\n Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis, as used in EVM, is the explanation (cause,\\nimpact, and corrective actions) for cost (CV EV  AC), schedule (SV EV  PV), and variance at completion\\n(VAC BAC  EAC) variances. Cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements.\\nFor projects not using formal earned value analysis, similar variance analyses can be performed by comparing\\nplanned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance.\\nFurther analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedule\\nbaseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed. Cost performance measurements are used to assess\\nthe magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline. An important aspect of project cost control includes\\ndetermining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline (see Section 7.3.3.1) and deciding\\nwhether corrective or preventive action is required. The percentage range of acceptable variances will tend to\\ndecrease as more work is accomplished. Examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to:\\n Schedule variance. Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the difference\\nbetween the earned value and the planned value. It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behind\\nthe planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on a project. It\\nis equal to the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The EVA schedule variance is a useful metric\\nin that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. The EVA schedule\\nvariance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will have\\nbeen earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method (CPM) scheduling and\\nrisk management. Equation: SV EV  PV.\\n\\nCost variance. Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget deficit or surplus at a given point in time, expressed\\nas the difference between earned value and the actual cost. It isa measure of cost performance on a project.\\nIt is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC). The cost variance at the end of the project will\\nbe the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the actual amount spent. The CV is particularly\\ncritical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative CV is often\\ndifficult for the project to recover. Equation: CV EV  AC.\\n\\n259 Schedule performance index. The schedule performance index (SPI) is a measure of schedule efficiency\\n\\nexpressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value. It measures how efficiently the project team is\\naccomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index (CPI) to forecast\\nthe final project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed than\\nwas planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since the\\nSPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determine\\nwhether the project will finish ahead of or behind its planned finish date. The SPI is equal to the ratio of the\\nEV to the PV. Equation: SPI EV/PV.\\n\\nCost performance index. The cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost efficiency of budgeted\\nresources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVA metric\\nand measures the cost efficiency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrun\\nfor work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The CPI is\\nequal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: CPI EV/AC.\\n\\n Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determine\\n\\nif performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understanding\\nperformance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of BAC versus estimate at\\ncompletion (EAC) and completion dates. Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to:\\n\\nCharts. In earned value analysis, three parameters of planned value, earned value, and actual cost can benitored and reported on both a periodbyperiod basis (typically weekly or monthly) and on a cumulative\\nbasis. Figure 712 uses Scurves to display EV data for a project that is performing over budget and behind\\nthe schedule.\\n\\n260\\n\\n Forecasting. As the project progresses, the project team may develop a forecast for the estimate at completion\\n(EAC) that may differ from the budget at completion (BAC) based on the project performance. If it becomesbvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Forecasting\\nthe EAC involves making projections of conditions and events in the project’s future based on current\\nperformance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are generated,\\nupdated, and reissued based on work performance data (Section 4.3.3.2) that is provided as the project is\\nexecuted. The work performance information covers the project’s past performance and any information that\\ncould impact the project in the future.\\n\\nEACs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed, plus an estimate to complete (ETC)\\nthe remaining work. It is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the ETC,\\nbased on its experience to date. Earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of the\\nrequired EAC costs. The most common EAC forecasting approach is a manual, bottomup summation by the\\nproject manager and project team.\\n\\nThe project manager’s bottomup EAC method builds upon the actual costs and experience incurred for\\nthe work completed, and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. Equation: EAC =\\nAC + Bottomup ETC.\\n\\n261\\nThe project manager’s manual EAC is quickly compared with a range of calculated EACs representing\\nvarious risk scenarios. When calculating EAC values, the cumulative CPI and SPI values are typically\\nused. While EVM data quickly provide many statistical EACs, only three of the more common methods are\\ndescribed as follows:\\n EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted rate. This EAC method accepts the actual project\\nperformance to date (whether favorable or unfavorable) as represented by the actual costs, and predicts\\nthat all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. When actual performance is unfavorable,\\nthe assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when supported by project\\nrisk analysis. Equation: EAC AC + (BAC  EV).\\n. EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present CPI. This method assumes that what the project has\\nexperienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. The ETC work is assumed to be performed\\nat the same cumulative cost performance index (CPI) as that incurred by the project to date. Equation:\\nEAC BAC / CPI.\\n EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI factors. In this forecast, the ETC work will be\\nperformed at an efficiency rate that considers both the cost and schedule performance indices. Thisethod is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort. Variations of thisethod weight the CPI and SPI at different values (e.g., 80/20, 50/50, or some other ratio) according to\\nthe project manager’s judgment. Equation: EAC AC + [(BAC  EV) / (CPI x SPI)].\\n\\n Reserve analysis. Described in Section 7.2.2.6. During cost control, reserve analysis is used to monitor the\\n\\nstatus of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed or\\nif additional reserves need to be requested. As work on the project progresses, these reserves may be used as\\nplanned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. Conversely, when opportunities are captured\\nand resulting in cost savings, funds may be added to the contingency amount, or taken from the project asargin/profit.\\n\\nIf the identified risks do not occur, the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget to\\nfree up resources for other projects or operations. Additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a need\\nto request that additional reserves be added to the project budget.\\n\\n262\\n\\n\\n7.4.2.3 TOCOMPLETE PERFORMANCE INDEX\\n\\nThe tocomplete performance index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved with\\nthe remaining resources in order to meet a specified management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish\\nthe outstanding work to the remaining budget. TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved on the\\nremaining work to meet a specified management goal, such as the BAC or the EAC. If it becomes obvious that the BAC\\nis no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace che\\nBAC in the TCPI calculation. The equation for the TCP! based on the BAC: (BAC  EV) / (BAC  AC).\\n\\nThe TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 713. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower left a. th: work\\nremaining (defined as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which can be either ti.e CAC ininus the\\nAC, or the EAC minus the AC).\\n\\nIf the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 713), all future work of .5 project will need\\nto be performed immediately in the range of the TCPI (BAC) (as reflected in the top ‘ine o: Figure 713) to stay\\nwithin the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgriet atl based on a number of\\nconsiderations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and technical pe.tor nate. This level of performance\\nis displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for the TCPI is based on the EAx: (BAC  EV) / (EAC  AC). The EVM\\nformulas are provided in Table 71.\\n\\n263\\n264 \\n7.4.2.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems are often used to monitor the three EVM\\ndimensions (PV, EV, and AC), to display graphical trends, and to forecast a range of possible final project results.\\n\\n7.4.3 CONTROL COSTS: OUTPUTS\\n\\n7.4.3.1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATION\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work is\\nperforming compared to the cost baseline. Variances in the work performed and the cost of the work are evaluated at\\nthe work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, CV, CPI, EAC, VAC, and TCPI\\nare documented for inclusion in work performance reports (Section 4.5.3.1).\\n\\n265\\n7.4.3.2 COST FORECASTS\\n\\nEither a calculated EAC value or a bottomup EAC value is documented and communicated to stakeholders.\\n\\n7.4.3.3 CHANGE REQUESTS\\n\\nDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Analysis of project performance may result in a change request to the cost and\\nschedule baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for review\\nand disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6).\\n\\n7.4.3.4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATES\\n\\nAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a change\\nrequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to:\\n\\n Cost management plan. Described in Section 7.1.3.1. Changes to the cost management plan, such as changes\\nto control thresholds or specified levels of accuracy required in managing the project’s cost, are incorporated in\\nresponse to feedback from relevant stakeholders.\\n\\n Cost baseline. Described in Section 7.3.3.1. Changes to the cost baseline are incorporated in response to\\napproved changes in scope, resources, or cost estimates. In some cases, cost variances can be so severe that a\\nrevised cost baseline is needed to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.\\n\\n Performance measurement baseline. Described in Section 4.2.3.1. Changes to the performance measurement\\nbaseline are incorporated in response to approved changes in scope, schedule performance, or cost estimates.\\nIn some cases, the performance variances can be so severe that a change request is put forth to revise the\\nperformance measurement baseline to provide a realistic basis for performance measurement.\\n\\n266 \\n7.4.3.5 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATES\\nProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to:\\n Assumption log.

The key benefit of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how the projectcosts will be managed throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. Theinputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 72. Figure 73 depicts the data flowdiagram of the process.235The cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework for each of the costanagement processes so that performance of the processes will be efficient and coordinated. The cost managementprocesses and their associated tools and techniques are documented in the cost management plan. The cost managementplan is a component of the project management plan.7.1.1 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: INPUTS | 1. PROJECT CHARTERDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. The project charter provides the preapproved financial resources from which the detailedproject costs are developed. The project charter also defines the project approval requirements that will influence theanagement of the project costs. | 2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan establishes thecriteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule managementplan provides processes and controls that will impact cost estimation and management. Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides the approach foridentifying, analyzing, and monitoring risks. The risk management plan provides processes and controls that willimpact cost estimation and management. | 3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Cost Management process include but are notlimited to: Organizational culture and structure can influence cost management. Market conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the regional and global markets. Currency exchange rates for project costs are sourced from more than one country.236  Published commercial information such as resource cost rate information is often available from commercialdatabases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.Published seller price lists are another source of information. Project management information system provides alternative possibilities for managing cost. Productivity differences in different parts of the world can have a large influence on the cost of projects. | 4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Cost Management process include but are not limited to: Financial controls procedures (e.g., time reporting, required expenditure and disbursement reviews, accountingcodes, and standard contract provisions); Historical information and lessons learned repository; Financial databases; and Existing formal and informal cost estimating and budgetingrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines.7.1.2 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics: Previous similar projects; Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; Cost estimating and budgeting; and Earned value management.237 | 2 DATA ANALYSISA data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.Alternatives analysis can include reviewing strategic funding options such as: selffunding, funding with equity, orfunding with debt. It can also include consideration of ways to acquire project resources such as making, purchasing,renting, or leasing. | 3 MEETINGSProject teams may hold planning meetings to develop the cost management plan. Attendees may include the projectanager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility forproject costs, and others as needed.7.1.3 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS | 1. COST MANAGEMENT PLANThe cost management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how the project costs willbe planned, structured, and controlled. The cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques aredocumented in the cost management plan.For example, the cost management plan can establish the following: Units of measure. Each unit used in measurements (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures;eters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures; or lump sum in currency form) is definedfor each of the resources. Level of precision. This is the degree to which cost estimates will be rounded up or down (e.g., US$995.59 toUS$1,000), based on the scope of the activities and magnitude of the project. Level of accuracy. The acceptable range (e.g., +10%) used in determining realistic cost estimates is specified,and may include an amount for contingencies.238  Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides theframework for the cost management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates, budgets, and controlf costs. The WBS component used for the project cost accounting is called the control account. Eachcontrol account is assigned a unique code or account number(s) that links directly to the performingrganization’s accounting system. Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be specified to indicate anagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typicallyexpressed as percentage deviations from the baseline plan. Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules of performance measurement areset. For example, the cost management plan may: Define the points in the WBS at which measurement of control accounts will be performed; Establish the EVM techniques (e.g., weighted milestones, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to beemployed; and Specify tracking methodologies and the EVM computation equations for calculating projected estimate atcompletion (EAC) forecasts to provide a validity check on the bottomup EAC. Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various cost reports are defined. Additional details. Additional details about cost management activities include but are not limited to: Description of strategic funding choices, Procedure to account for fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and Procedure for project cost recording.For more specific information regarding earned value management, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned ValueManagement  Second Edition [17].7.2 ESTIMATE COSTSEstimate Costs is the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete projectwork. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the monetary resources required for the project. This processis performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this processare depicted in Figure 74. Figure 75 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.239A cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required to complete the activity. It is aprediction that is based on the information known at a given point in time. Cost estimates include the identification andconsideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project. Cost tradeoffs and risks should be considered,such as make versus buy, buy versus lease, and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project.Cost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency (i.e., dollars, euros, yen, etc.), although in someinstances other units of measure, such as staff hours or staff days, are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating theeffects of currency fluctuations.Cost estimates should be reviewed and refined during the course of the project to reflect additional detail as it becomesavailable and assumptions are tested. The accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses throughthe project life cycle. For example, a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimatein the range of 25% to +75%. Later in the project, as more information is known, definitive estimates could narrowthe range of accuracy to 5% to +10%. In some organizations, there are guidelines for when such refinements can beade and the degree of confidence or accuracy that is expected.Costs are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project. This includes but is not limited to labor,aterials, equipment, services, and facilities, as well as special categories such as an inflation allowance, cost offinancing, or contingency costs. Cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or in summary form.7.2.1 ESTIMATE COSTS: INPUTS | 1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Cost management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The cost management plan describes estimating methodsthat can be used and the level of precision and accuracy required for the cost estimate. Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The quality management plan describes the activitiesand resources necessary for the project management team to achieve the quality objectives set for the project.240  Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,and WBS dictionary: Project scope statement. The scope statement (Section 5.3.3.1) reflects funding constraints by period for theexpenditure of project funds or other financial assumptions and constraints. Work breakdown structure. The WBS (Section 5.4.3.1) provides the relationships among all the projectdeliverables and their various components. WBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary (Section 5.4.3.) and related detailed statements of work provide anidentification of the deliverables and a description of the work in each WBS component required to produceeach deliverable. | 2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard todeveloping cost estimates can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precision ofthe cost estimates. Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The schedule includes the type, quantity, and amount of timethat team and physical resources will be active on the project. The duration estimates (Section 6.4.3.1) willaffect cost estimates when resources are charged per unit of time and when there are seasonal fluctuationsin costs. The schedule also provides useful information for projects that incorporate the cost of financing(including interest charges). Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements identify the types and quantitiesf resources required for each work package or activity. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of individual project risks thathave been identified and prioritized, and for which risk responses are required. The risk register provides detailedinformation that can be used to estimate costs.241 | 3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to: Market conditions. These conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the market,from whom, and under what terms and conditions. Regional and/or global supply and demand conditions greatlyinfluence resource costs. Published commercial information. Resource cost rate information is often available from commercialdatabases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.Published seller price lists are another source of information. Exchange rates and inflation. For largescale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, thefluctuations of currencies and inflation need to be understood and built into the Estimate Cost process. | 4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to: Cost estimating policies, Cost estimating templates, Historical information and lessons learned repository.7.2.2 ESTIMATE COSTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics: Previous similar projects; Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; and Cost estimating methods.242  | 2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATINGDescribed in Section 6.4.2.2. Analogous cost estimating uses values, or attributes, of a previous project that aresimilar to the current project. Values and attributes of the projects may include but are not limited to: scope, cost, budget,duration, and measures of scale (e.g., size, weight). Comparison of these project values, or attributes, becomes the basisfor estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project. | 3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATINGDescribed in Section 6.4.2.3. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical dataand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This technique canproduce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. Parametriccost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods. | 4 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATINGDescribed in Section 6.4.2.5. Bottomup estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The costf individual work packages or activities is estimated to the greatest level of specified detail. The detailed costis then summarized or “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost andaccuracy of bottomup cost estimating are typically influenced by the size or other attributes of the individualactivity or work package. | 5 THREEPOINT ESTIMATINGDescribed in Section 6.4.2.4. The accuracy of singlepoint cost estimates may be improved by considering estimationuncertainty and risk and using three estimates to define an approximate range for an activity’s cost: Most likely (cM). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and anypredicted expenses. Optimistic (cO). The cost based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity. Pessimistic (cP). The cost based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.243Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected cost, cE, canbe calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The formulas are: Triangular distribution. cE (cO + cM + cP) / 3 Beta distribution. cE (CO + 4cM + cP) / 6Cost estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected cost and clarify the range ofuncertainty around the expected cost. | 6 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to: Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is a technique used to evaluate identified options in order to selectwhich options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work of the project. An example would beevaluating the cost, schedule, resource, and quality impacts of buying versus making a deliverable. Reserve analysis. Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances)to account for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated foridentified risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the knownunknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated, whilethe amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknownamount of rework. Contingency reserves can be provided at any level from the specific activity to the entireproject. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated cost, a fixed number, or may be developedby using quantitative analysis methods.As more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced,r eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identified in cost documentation. Contingency reserves are part ofthe cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project. Cost of quality. Assumptions about costs of quality (Section 8.1.2.3) may be used to prepare the estimates. Thisincludes evaluating the cost impact of additional investment in conformance versus the cost of nonconformance.It can also include looking at shortterm cost reductions versus the implication of more frequent problems latern in the product life cycle.244  | 7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. The project management information system can include spreadsheets, simulationsoftware, and statistical analysis tools to assist with cost estimating. Such tools simplify the use of some costestimatingtechniques and thereby facilitate rapid consideration of cost estimate alternatives. | 8 DECISION MAKINGThe decisionmaking techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to voting.Described in Section 5.2.2.4, voting is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome inthe form of future actions. These techniques are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy andcommitment to the emerging estimates.7.2.3 ESTIMATE COSTS: OUTPUTS | 1 COST ESTIMATESCost estimates include quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete project work, as well ascontingency amounts to account for identified risks, and management reserve to cover unplanned work. Cost estimatescan be presented in summary form or in detail. Costs are estimated for all resources that are applied to the costestimate. This includes but is not limited to direct labor, materials, equipment, services, facilities, information technology,and special categories such as cost of financing (including interest charges), an inflation allowance, exchange rates,r a cost contingency reserve. Indirect costs, if they are included in the project estimate, can be included at the activitylevel or at higher levels.245 | 2 BASIS OF ESTIMATESThe amount and type of additional details supporting the cost estimate vary by application area. Regardless ofthe level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the costestimate was derived.Supporting detail for cost estimates may include: Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed), Documentation of all assumptions made, Documentation of any known constraints, Documentation of identified risks included when estimating costs, Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., US$10,000 (+10%) to indicate that the item is expected tocost between a range of values), and Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate. | 3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. During the Cost Estimates process, new assumptions may beade, new constraints may be identified, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed.The assumption log should be updated with this new information. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated withtechniques that were efficient and effective in developing cost estimates. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may be updated when appropriate risk responsesare chosen and agreed upon during the Estimate Cost process.7.3 DETERMINE BUDGETDetermine Budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages toestablish an authorized cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the cost baseline againstwhich project performance can be monitored and controlled. This process is performed once or at predefined points inthe project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 76. Figure 77 depictsthe data flow diagram of the process.A project budget includes all the funds authorized to execute the project. The cost baseline is the approved version ofthe timephased project budget that includes contingency reserves, but excludes management reserves.246 Projectcharter2477.3.1 DETERMINE BUDGET: INPUTS | 1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Cost management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The cost management plan describes how the projectcosts will be structured into the project budget. Resource management plan. Described in Section 9.1.3.1. The resource management plan provides informationn rates (personnel and other resources), estimation of travel costs, and other foreseen costs that are necessaryto estimate the overall project budget. Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,and WBS dictionary details for cost estimation and management. | 2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSExamples of project documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Basis of estimates. Described in Section 6.4.3.2. Supporting detail for cost estimates contained in the basis forestimates should specify any basic assumptions dealing with the inclusion or exclusion of indirect or other costsin the project budget. Cost estimates. Described in Section  | 1. Cost estimates for each activity within a work package areaggregated to obtain a cost estimate for each work package. Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The project schedule includes planned start and finish datesfor the project’s activities, milestones, work packages, and control accounts. This information can be used toaggregate costs to the calendar periods in which the costs are planned to be incurred. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register should be reviewed to consider how to aggregatethe risk response costs. Updates to the risk register are included with project documents updates described inSection 11.5.3.3.248  | 3 BUSINE DOCUMENTSDescribed in Section 1.2.6. The business documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include butare not limited to: Business case. The business case identifies the critical success factors for the project, including financialsuccess factors. Benefits management plan. The benefits management plan includes the target benefits, such as net presentvalue calculations, timeframe for realizing benefits, and the metrics associated with the benefits. | 4 AGREEMENTSDescribed in Section 12.2.3.2. Applicable agreement information and costs relating to products, services, or resultsthat have been or will be purchased are included when determining the budget. | 5 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limitedto exchange rates. For largescale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the fluctuations ofcurrencies need to be understood and built into the Determine Budget process. | 6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Determine Budget process include but are not limited to: Existing formal and informal cost budgetingrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines; Historical information and lessons learned repository. Cost budgeting tools; and Reporting methods.2497.3.2 DETERMINE BUDGET: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics: Previous similar projects; Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; Financial principles; and Funding requirement and sources. | 2 COST AGGREGATIONCost estimates are aggregated by work packages in accordance with the WBS. The work package cost estimatesare then aggregated for the higher component levels of the WBS (such as control accounts) and, ultimately, for theentire project. | 3 DATA ANALYSISA data analysis technique that can be used in the Determine Budget process includes but is not limited to reserveanalysis, which can establish the management reserves for the project. Management reserves are an amount ofthe project budget withheld for management control purposes and are reserved for unforeseen work that is withinscope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address the unknown unknowns that can affect a project.The management reserve is not included in the cost baseline but is part of the overall project budget and fundingrequirements. When an amount of management reserves is used to fund unforeseen work, the amount of managementreserve used is added to the cost baseline, thus requiring an approved change to the cost baseline.250  | 4 HISTORICAL INFORMATION REVIEWReviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates. Historicalinformation may include project characteristics (parameters) to develop mathematical models to predict total projectcosts. Such models may be simple (e.g., residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space)r complex (e.g., one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors, each of whichhas numerous points within it).Both the cost and accuracy of analogous and parametric models can vary widely. They are most likely to bereliable when: Historical information used to develop the model is accurate, Parameters used in the model are readily quantifiable, and Models are scalable, such that they work for large projects, small projects, and phases of a project. | 5 FUNDING LIMIT RECONCILIATIONThe expenditure of funds should be reconciled with any funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project.A variance between the funding limits and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the rescheduling ofwork to level out the rate of expenditures. This is accomplished by placing imposed date constraints for work intothe project schedule. | 6 FINANCINGFinancing entails acquiring funding for projects. It is common for longterm infrastructure, industrial, and publicservices projects to seek external sources of funds. If a project is funded externally, the funding entity may have certainrequirements that are required to be met.2517.3.3 DETERMINE BUDGET: OUTPUTS | 1 COST BASELINEThe cost baseline is the approved version of the timephased project budget, excluding any management reserves,which can only be changed through formal change control procedures. It is used as a basis for comparison to actualresults. The cost baseline is developed as a summation of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities.Figure 78 illustrates the various components of the project budget and cost baseline. Cost estimates for tie va.iousproject activities, along with any contingency reserves (see Section  | 6) for these activities, are oox,egatedinto their associated work package costs. The work package cost estimates, along with any corusec.y reservesestimated for the work packages, are aggregated into control accounts. The summation of 1.2 ec:trol accountsake up the cost baseline. Since the cost estimates that make up the cost baseline are dire cly ticd to the scheduleactivities, this enables a timephased view of the cost baseline, which is typically displaye4 1. tie form of an Scurve,as is illustrated in Figure 79. For projects that use earned value management, the ccst Jas «tine is referred to as theperformance measurement baseline.Management reserves (Section  | 3) are added to the cost baseline to droduce the project budget. As changeswarranting the use of management reserves arise, the change control preccss ‘s used to obtain approval to move theapplicable management reserve funds into the cost baseline.252 253 | 2 PROJECT FUNDING REQUIREMENTSTotal funding requirements and periodic funding requirements (e.g., quarterly, annually) are derived from the costbaseline. The cost baseline will include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities. Funding often occurs inincremental amounts, and may not be evenly distributed, which appear as steps in Figure 79. The total funds requiredare those included in the cost baseline plus management reserves, if any. Funding requirements may include thesource(s) of the funding. | 3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not !.7ic to: Cost estimates. Described in Section  | 1. Cost estimates are updated to record any a idit. onal information. Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. Estimated costs for each activity ma, 1. corded as part of theproject schedule. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. New risks identified durine thi. nrucess are recorded in the riskregister and managed using the risk management processes.7.4 CONTROL COSTSControl Costs is the process of monitoring the status of the projec’. .. update the project costs and managing changesto the cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that the cos‘ Luseline is maintained throughout the project. Thisprocess is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tcsls aid cechniques, and outputs of this process are depictedin Figure 710. Figure 711 depicts the data flow diagram ef cne process.254 Projectcharter255Updating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date. Any increase to the authorized budget cannly be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Monitoring the expenditure offunds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project, otherthan to track the outflow of funds. Much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between theconsumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures. The key to effective cost controlis the management of the approved cost baseline.Project cost control includes: Influencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline; Ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner; Managing the actual changes when and as they occur; Ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period, by WBS component, by activity,and in total for the project; Monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved cost baseline; Monitoring work performance against funds expended; Preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource usage; Informing appropriate stakeholders of all approved changes and associated cost; and Bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits.7.4.1 CONTROL COSTS: INPUTS | 1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Cost management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The cost management plan describes how the projectcosts will be managed and controlled. Cost baseline. Described in Section  | 1.

Lessons learned earlier in the project can be applied to laterphases in the project to improve cost control. | 3 PROJECT FUNDING REQUIREMENTSDescribed in Section  | 2. The project funding requirements include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities. | 4 WORK PERFORMANCE DATADescribed in Section 4.3.3.2. Work performance data contains data on project status such as which costs have beenauthorized, incurred, invoiced, and paid. | 5 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Control Costs process include but are not limited to: Existing formal and informal cost controlrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines; Cost control tools; and Monitoring and reporting methods to be used.7.4.2 CONTROL COSTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Examples of expert judgment during the Control Costs process include but are notlimited to: Variance analysis, Earned value analysis, Forecasting, and Financial analysis.257 | 2 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used to control costs include but are not limited to: Earned value analysis (EVA). Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to theactual schedule and cost performance. EVM integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedulebaseline to form the performance measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors three key dimensions foreach work package and control account: Planned value. Planned value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the authorizedbudget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure (WBS) component,not including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a givenpoint in time, planned value defines the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of thePY is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total planned value for theproject is also known as budget at completion (BAC). Earned value. Earned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorizedfor that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The EV beingeasured needs to be related to the PMB, and the EV measured cannot be greater than the authorizedPV budget for a component. The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progresseasurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Projectanagers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the longterm performance trends.Actual cost. Actual cost (AC) is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during aspecific time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The ACneeds to correspond in definition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., direct hoursnly, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spentto achieve the EV will be measured.258 Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis, as used in EVM, is the explanation (cause,impact, and corrective actions) for cost (CV EV  AC), schedule (SV EV  PV), and variance at completion(VAC BAC  EAC) variances. Cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements.For projects not using formal earned value analysis, similar variance analyses can be performed by comparingplanned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance.Further analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedulebaseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed. Cost performance measurements are used to assessthe magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline. An important aspect of project cost control includesdetermining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline (see Section  | 1) and decidingwhether corrective or preventive action is required. The percentage range of acceptable variances will tend todecrease as more work is accomplished. Examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to: Schedule variance. Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the differencebetween the earned value and the planned value. It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behindthe planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on a project. Itis equal to the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The EVA schedule variance is a useful metricin that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. The EVA schedulevariance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will havebeen earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method (CPM) scheduling andrisk management. Equation: SV EV  PV.Cost variance. Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget deficit or surplus at a given point in time, expressedas the difference between earned value and the actual cost. It isa measure of cost performance on a project.It is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC). The cost variance at the end of the project willbe the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the actual amount spent. The CV is particularlycritical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative CV is oftendifficult for the project to recover. Equation: CV EV  AC.259 Schedule performance index. The schedule performance index (SPI) is a measure of schedule efficiencyexpressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value. It measures how efficiently the project team isaccomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index (CPI) to forecastthe final project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed thanwas planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since theSPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determinewhether the project will finish ahead of or behind its planned finish date. The SPI is equal to the ratio of theEV to the PV. Equation: SPI EV/PV.Cost performance index. The cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost efficiency of budgetedresources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVA metricand measures the cost efficiency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrunfor work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The CPI isequal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: CPI EV/AC. Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determineif performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understandingperformance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of BAC versus estimate atcompletion (EAC) and completion dates. Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to:Charts. In earned value analysis, three parameters of planned value, earned value, and actual cost can benitored and reported on both a periodbyperiod basis (typically weekly or monthly) and on a cumulativebasis. Figure 712 uses Scurves to display EV data for a project that is performing over budget and behindthe schedule.260 Forecasting. As the project progresses, the project team may develop a forecast for the estimate at completion(EAC) that may differ from the budget at completion (BAC) based on the project performance. If it becomesbvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Forecastingthe EAC involves making projections of conditions and events in the project’s future based on currentperformance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are generated,updated, and reissued based on work performance data (Section 4.3.3.2) that is provided as the project isexecuted. The work performance information covers the project’s past performance and any information thatcould impact the project in the future.EACs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed, plus an estimate to complete (ETC)the remaining work. It is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the ETC,based on its experience to date. Earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of therequired EAC costs. The most common EAC forecasting approach is a manual, bottomup summation by theproject manager and project team.The project manager’s bottomup EAC method builds upon the actual costs and experience incurred forthe work completed, and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. Equation: EAC =AC + Bottomup ETC.261The project manager’s manual EAC is quickly compared with a range of calculated EACs representingvarious risk scenarios. When calculating EAC values, the cumulative CPI and SPI values are typicallyused. While EVM data quickly provide many statistical EACs, only three of the more common methods aredescribed as follows: EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted rate. This EAC method accepts the actual projectperformance to date (whether favorable or unfavorable) as represented by the actual costs, and predictsthat all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. When actual performance is unfavorable,the assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when supported by projectrisk analysis. Equation: EAC AC + (BAC  EV).. EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present CPI. This method assumes that what the project hasexperienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. The ETC work is assumed to be performedat the same cumulative cost performance index (CPI) as that incurred by the project to date. Equation:EAC BAC / CPI. EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI factors. In this forecast, the ETC work will beperformed at an efficiency rate that considers both the cost and schedule performance indices. Thisethod is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort. Variations of thisethod weight the CPI and SPI at different values (e.g., 80/20, 50/50, or some other ratio) according tothe project manager’s judgment. Equation: EAC AC + [(BAC  EV) / (CPI x SPI)]. Reserve analysis. Described in Section  | 6. During cost control, reserve analysis is used to monitor thestatus of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed orif additional reserves need to be requested. As work on the project progresses, these reserves may be used asplanned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. Conversely, when opportunities are capturedand resulting in cost savings, funds may be added to the contingency amount, or taken from the project asargin/profit.If the identified risks do not occur, the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget tofree up resources for other projects or operations. Additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a needto request that additional reserves be added to the project budget.262 | 3 TOCOMPLETE PERFORMANCE INDEXThe tocomplete performance index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved withthe remaining resources in order to meet a specified management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to finishthe outstanding work to the remaining budget. TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved on theremaining work to meet a specified management goal, such as the BAC or the EAC. If it becomes obvious that the BACis no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace cheBAC in the TCPI calculation. The equation for the TCP! based on the BAC: (BAC  EV) / (BAC  AC).The TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 713. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower left a. th: workremaining (defined as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which can be either ti.e CAC ininus theAC, or the EAC minus the AC).If the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 713), all future work of .5 project will needto be performed immediately in the range of the TCPI (BAC) (as reflected in the top ‘ine o: Figure 713) to staywithin the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgriet atl based on a number ofconsiderations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and technical pe.tor nate. This level of performanceis displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for the TCPI is based on the EAx: (BAC  EV) / (EAC  AC). The EVMformulas are provided in Table 71.263264  | 4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. Project management information systems are often used to monitor the three EVMdimensions (PV, EV, and AC), to display graphical trends, and to forecast a range of possible final project results.7.4.3 CONTROL COSTS: OUTPUTS | 1 WORK PERFORMANCE INFORMATIONDescribed in Section 4.5.1.3. Work performance information includes information on how the project work isperforming compared to the cost baseline. Variances in the work performed and the cost of the work are evaluated atthe work package level and control account level. For projects using earned value analysis, CV, CPI, EAC, VAC, and TCPIare documented for inclusion in work performance reports (Section 4.5.3.1).265 | 2 COST FORECASTSEither a calculated EAC value or a bottomup EAC value is documented and communicated to stakeholders. | 3 CHANGE REQUESTSDescribed in Section 4.3.3.4. Analysis of project performance may result in a change request to the cost andschedule baselines or other components of the project management plan. Change requests are processed for reviewand disposition through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). | 4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN UPDATESAny change to the project management plan goes through the organization’s change control process via a changerequest. Components that may require a change request for the project management plan include but are not limited to: Cost management plan. Described in Section  | 1. Changes to the cost management plan, such as changesto control thresholds or specified levels of accuracy required in managing the project’s cost, are incorporated inresponse to feedback from relevant stakeholders.

       "'1 PLAN COST MANAGEMENTPlan Cost Management is the process of defining how the project costs will be estimated, budgeted, managed,onitored, and controlled. The key benefit of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how the projectcosts will be managed throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. Theinputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 72. Figure 73 depicts the data flowdiagram of the process.235The cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework for each of the costanagement processes so that performance of the processes will be efficient and coordinated. The cost managementprocesses and their associated tools and techniques are documented in the cost management plan. The cost managementplan is a component of the project management plan.7.1.1 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: INPUTS | 1. PROJECT CHARTERDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. The project charter provides the preapproved financial resources from which the detailedproject costs are developed. The project charter also defines the project approval requirements that will influence theanagement of the project costs. | 2 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Schedule management plan. Described in Section 6.1.3.1. The schedule management plan establishes thecriteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The schedule managementplan provides processes and controls that will impact cost estimation and management. Risk management plan. Described in Section 11.1.3.1. The risk management plan provides the approach foridentifying, analyzing, and monitoring risks. The risk management plan provides processes and controls that willimpact cost estimation and management. | 3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Cost Management process include but are notlimited to: Organizational culture and structure can influence cost management. Market conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the regional and global markets. Currency exchange rates for project costs are sourced from more than one country.236  Published commercial information such as resource cost rate information is often available from commercialdatabases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.Published seller price lists are another source of information. Project management information system provides alternative possibilities for managing cost. Productivity differences in different parts of the world can have a large influence on the cost of projects. | 4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Cost Management process include but are not limited to: Financial controls procedures (e.g., time reporting, required expenditure and disbursement reviews, accountingcodes, and standard contract provisions); Historical information and lessons learned repository; Financial databases; and Existing formal and informal cost estimating and budgetingrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines.7.1.2 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics: Previous similar projects; Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; Cost estimating and budgeting; and Earned value management.237 | 2 DATA ANALYSISA data analysis technique that can be used for this process includes but is not limited to alternatives analysis.Alternatives analysis can include reviewing strategic funding options such as: selffunding, funding with equity, orfunding with debt. It can also include consideration of ways to acquire project resources such as making, purchasing,renting, or leasing. | 3 MEETINGSProject teams may hold planning meetings to develop the cost management plan. Attendees may include the projectanager, the project sponsor, selected project team members, selected stakeholders, anyone with responsibility forproject costs, and others as needed.7.1.3 PLAN COST MANAGEMENT: OUTPUTS | 1. COST MANAGEMENT PLANThe cost management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how the project costs willbe planned, structured, and controlled. The cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques aredocumented in the cost management plan.For example, the cost management plan can establish the following: Units of measure. Each unit used in measurements (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures;eters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures; or lump sum in currency form) is definedfor each of the resources. Level of precision. This is the degree to which cost estimates will be rounded up or down (e.g., US$995.59 toUS$1,000), based on the scope of the activities and magnitude of the project. Level of accuracy. The acceptable range (e.g., +10%) used in determining realistic cost estimates is specified,and may include an amount for contingencies.238  Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides theframework for the cost management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates, budgets, and controlf costs. The WBS component used for the project cost accounting is called the control account. Eachcontrol account is assigned a unique code or account number(s) that links directly to the performingrganization’s accounting system. Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be specified to indicate anagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typicallyexpressed as percentage deviations from the baseline plan. Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules of performance measurement areset. For example, the cost management plan may: Define the points in the WBS at which measurement of control accounts will be performed; Establish the EVM techniques (e.g., weighted milestones, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to beemployed; and Specify tracking methodologies and the EVM computation equations for calculating projected estimate atcompletion (EAC) forecasts to provide a validity check on the bottomup EAC. Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various cost reports are defined. Additional details. Additional details about cost management activities include but are not limited to: Description of strategic funding choices, Procedure to account for fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and Procedure for project cost recording.For more specific information regarding earned value management, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned ValueManagement  Second Edition [17].7.2 ESTIMATE COSTSEstimate Costs is the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete projectwork. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the monetary resources required for the project. This processis performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this processare depicted in Figure 74. Figure 75 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.239A cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required to complete the activity. It is aprediction that is based on the information known at a given point in time. Cost estimates include the identification andconsideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project. Cost tradeoffs and risks should be considered,such as make versus buy, buy versus lease, and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project.Cost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency (i.e., dollars, euros, yen, etc.), although in someinstances other units of measure, such as staff hours or staff days, are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating theeffects of currency fluctuations.Cost estimates should be reviewed and refined during the course of the project to reflect additional detail as it becomesavailable and assumptions are tested. The accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses throughthe project life cycle. For example, a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimatein the range of 25% to +75%. Later in the project, as more information is known, definitive estimates could narrowthe range of accuracy to 5% to +10%. In some organizations, there are guidelines for when such refinements can beade and the degree of confidence or accuracy that is expected.Costs are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project. This includes but is not limited to labor,aterials, equipment, services, and facilities, as well as special categories such as an inflation allowance, cost offinancing, or contingency costs. Cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or in summary form.7.2.1 ESTIMATE COSTS: INPUTS | 1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1. Project management plan components include but are not limited to: Cost management plan. Described in Section  | 1. The cost management plan describes estimating methodsthat can be used and the level of precision and accuracy required for the cost estimate. Quality management plan. Described in Section 8.1.3.1. The quality management plan describes the activitiesand resources necessary for the project management team to achieve the quality objectives set for the project.240  Scope baseline. Described in Section 5.4.3.1. The scope baseline includes the project scope statement, WBS,and WBS dictionary: Project scope statement. The scope statement (Section 5.3.3.1) reflects funding constraints by period for theexpenditure of project funds or other financial assumptions and constraints. Work breakdown structure. The WBS (Section 5.4.3.1) provides the relationships among all the projectdeliverables and their various components. WBS dictionary. The WBS dictionary (Section 5.4.3.) and related detailed statements of work provide anidentification of the deliverables and a description of the work in each WBS component required to produceeach deliverable. | 2 PROJECT DOCUMENTSProject documents that can be considered as inputs for this process include but are not limited to: Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. Lessons learned earlier in the project with regard todeveloping cost estimates can be applied to later phases in the project to improve the accuracy and precision ofthe cost estimates. Project schedule. Described in Section 6.5.3.2. The schedule includes the type, quantity, and amount of timethat team and physical resources will be active on the project. The duration estimates (Section 6.4.3.1) willaffect cost estimates when resources are charged per unit of time and when there are seasonal fluctuationsin costs. The schedule also provides useful information for projects that incorporate the cost of financing(including interest charges). Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements identify the types and quantitiesf resources required for each work package or activity. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of individual project risks thathave been identified and prioritized, and for which risk responses are required. The risk register provides detailedinformation that can be used to estimate costs.241 | 3 ENTERPRISE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSThe enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to: Market conditions. These conditions describe what products, services, and results are available in the market,from whom, and under what terms and conditions. Regional and/or global supply and demand conditions greatlyinfluence resource costs. Published commercial information. Resource cost rate information is often available from commercialdatabases that track skills and human resource costs, and provide standard costs for material and equipment.Published seller price lists are another source of information. Exchange rates and inflation. For largescale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, thefluctuations of currencies and inflation need to be understood and built into the Estimate Cost process. | 4 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to: Cost estimating policies, Cost estimating templates, Historical information and lessons learned repository.7.2.2 ESTIMATE COSTS: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1 Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics: Previous similar projects; Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; and Cost estimating methods.242  | 2 ANALOGOUS ESTIMATINGDescribed in Section 6.4.2.2. Analogous cost estimating uses values, or attributes, of a previous project that aresimilar to the current project. Values and attributes of the projects may include but are not limited to: scope, cost, budget,duration, and measures of scale (e.g., size, weight). Comparison of these project values, or attributes, becomes the basisfor estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project. | 3 PARAMETRIC ESTIMATINGDescribed in Section 6.4.2.3. Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical dataand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This technique canproduce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. Parametriccost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods. | 4 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATINGDescribed in Section 6.4.2.5. Bottomup estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The costf individual work packages or activities is estimated to the greatest level of specified detail. The detailed costis then summarized or “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost andaccuracy of bottomup cost estimating are typically influenced by the size or other attributes of the individualactivity or work package. | 5 THREEPOINT ESTIMATINGDescribed in Section 6.4.2.4. The accuracy of singlepoint cost estimates may be improved by considering estimationuncertainty and risk and using three estimates to define an approximate range for an activity’s cost: Most likely (cM). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and anypredicted expenses. Optimistic (cO). The cost based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity. Pessimistic (cP). The cost based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.243Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected cost, cE, canbe calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The formulas are: Triangular distribution. cE (cO + cM + cP) / 3 Beta distribution. cE (CO + 4cM + cP) / 6Cost estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected cost and clarify the range ofuncertainty around the expected cost. | 6 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to: Alternatives analysis. Alternatives analysis is a technique used to evaluate identified options in order to selectwhich options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work of the project. An example would beevaluating the cost, schedule, resource, and quality impacts of buying versus making a deliverable. Reserve analysis. Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances)to account for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated foridentified risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the knownunknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated, whilethe amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknownamount of rework. Contingency reserves can be provided at any level from the specific activity to the entireproject. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated cost, a fixed number, or may be developedby using quantitative analysis methods.As more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced,r eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identified in cost documentation. Contingency reserves are part ofthe cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project. Cost of quality. Assumptions about costs of quality (Section 8.1.2.3) may be used to prepare the estimates. Thisincludes evaluating the cost impact of additional investment in conformance versus the cost of nonconformance.It can also include looking at shortterm cost reductions versus the implication of more frequent problems latern in the product life cycle.244  | 7 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2. The project management information system can include spreadsheets, simulationsoftware, and statistical analysis tools to assist with cost estimating. Such tools simplify the use of some costestimatingtechniques and thereby facilitate rapid consideration of cost estimate alternatives. | 8 DECISION MAKINGThe decisionmaking techniques that can be used in the Estimate Costs process include but are not limited to voting.Described in Section 5.2.2.4, voting is an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome inthe form of future actions. These techniques are useful for engaging team members to improve estimate accuracy andcommitment to the emerging estimates.7.2.3 ESTIMATE COSTS: OUTPUTS | 1 COST ESTIMATESCost estimates include quantitative assessments of the probable costs required to complete project work, as well ascontingency amounts to account for identified risks, and management reserve to cover unplanned work. Cost estimatescan be presented in summary form or in detail. Costs are estimated for all resources that are applied to the costestimate. This includes but is not limited to direct labor, materials, equipment, services, facilities, information technology,and special categories such as cost of financing (including interest charges), an inflation allowance, exchange rates,r a cost contingency reserve. Indirect costs, if they are included in the project estimate, can be included at the activitylevel or at higher levels.245 | 2 BASIS OF ESTIMATESThe amount and type of additional details supporting the cost estimate vary by application area. Regardless ofthe level of detail, the supporting documentation should provide a clear and complete understanding of how the costestimate was derived.Supporting detail for cost estimates may include: Documentation of the basis of the estimate (i.e., how it was developed), Documentation of all assumptions made, Documentation of any known constraints, Documentation of identified risks included when estimating costs, Indication of the range of possible estimates (e.g., US$10,000 (+10%) to indicate that the item is expected tocost between a range of values), and Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate. | 3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not limited to: Assumption log. Described in Section 4.1.3.2. During the Cost Estimates process, new assumptions may beade, new constraints may be identified, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed.The assumption log should be updated with this new information. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated withtechniques that were efficient and effective in developing cost estimates. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may be updated when appropriate risk responsesare chosen and agreed upon during the Estimate Cost process.7.3 DETERMINE BUDGETDetermine Budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages toestablish an authorized cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the cost baseline againstwhich project performance can be monitored and controlled. This process is performed once or at predefined points inthe project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 76. Figure 77 depictsthe data flow diagram of the process.A project budget includes all the funds authorized to execute the project. The cost baseline is the approved version ofthe timephased project budget that includes contingency reserves, but excludes management reserves.246 Projectcharter2477.3.1 DETERMINE BUDGET: INPUTS | 1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1.

For largescale projects that extend multiple years with multiple currencies, the fluctuations ofcurrencies need to be understood and built into the Determine Budget process. | 6 ORGANIZATIONAL PROCE AETSThe organizational process assets that can influence the Determine Budget process include but are not limited to: Existing formal and informal cost budgetingrelated policies, procedures, and guidelines; Historical information and lessons learned repository. Cost budgeting tools; and Reporting methods.2497.3.2 DETERMINE BUDGET: TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES | 1 EXPERT JUDGMENTDescribed in Section 4.1.2.1. Expertise should be considered from individuals or groups with specialized knowledger training in the following topics: Previous similar projects; Information in the industry, discipline, and application area; Financial principles; and Funding requirement and sources. | 2 COST AGGREGATIONCost estimates are aggregated by work packages in accordance with the WBS. The work package cost estimatesare then aggregated for the higher component levels of the WBS (such as control accounts) and, ultimately, for theentire project. | 3 DATA ANALYSISA data analysis technique that can be used in the Determine Budget process includes but is not limited to reserveanalysis, which can establish the management reserves for the project. Management reserves are an amount ofthe project budget withheld for management control purposes and are reserved for unforeseen work that is withinscope of the project. Management reserves are intended to address the unknown unknowns that can affect a project.The management reserve is not included in the cost baseline but is part of the overall project budget and fundingrequirements. When an amount of management reserves is used to fund unforeseen work, the amount of managementreserve used is added to the cost baseline, thus requiring an approved change to the cost baseline.250  | 4 HISTORICAL INFORMATION REVIEWReviewing historical information can assist in developing parametric estimates or analogous estimates. Historicalinformation may include project characteristics (parameters) to develop mathematical models to predict total projectcosts. Such models may be simple (e.g., residential home construction is based on a certain cost per square foot of space)r complex (e.g., one model of software development costing uses multiple separate adjustment factors, each of whichhas numerous points within it).Both the cost and accuracy of analogous and parametric models can vary widely. They are most likely to bereliable when: Historical information used to develop the model is accurate, Parameters used in the model are readily quantifiable, and Models are scalable, such that they work for large projects, small projects, and phases of a project. | 5 FUNDING LIMIT RECONCILIATIONThe expenditure of funds should be reconciled with any funding limits on the commitment of funds for the project.A variance between the funding limits and the planned expenditures will sometimes necessitate the rescheduling ofwork to level out the rate of expenditures. This is accomplished by placing imposed date constraints for work intothe project schedule. | 6 FINANCINGFinancing entails acquiring funding for projects. It is common for longterm infrastructure, industrial, and publicservices projects to seek external sources of funds. If a project is funded externally, the funding entity may have certainrequirements that are required to be met.2517.3.3 DETERMINE BUDGET: OUTPUTS | 1 COST BASELINEThe cost baseline is the approved version of the timephased project budget, excluding any management reserves,which can only be changed through formal change control procedures. It is used as a basis for comparison to actualresults. The cost baseline is developed as a summation of the approved budgets for the different schedule activities.Figure 78 illustrates the various components of the project budget and cost baseline. Cost estimates for tie va.iousproject activities, along with any contingency reserves (see Section  | 6) for these activities, are oox,egatedinto their associated work package costs. The work package cost estimates, along with any corusec.y reservesestimated for the work packages, are aggregated into control accounts. The summation of 1.2 ec:trol accountsake up the cost baseline. Since the cost estimates that make up the cost baseline are dire cly ticd to the scheduleactivities, this enables a timephased view of the cost baseline, which is typically displaye4 1. tie form of an Scurve,as is illustrated in Figure 79. For projects that use earned value management, the ccst Jas «tine is referred to as theperformance measurement baseline.Management reserves (Section  | 3) are added to the cost baseline to droduce the project budget. As changeswarranting the use of management reserves arise, the change control preccss ‘s used to obtain approval to move theapplicable management reserve funds into the cost baseline.252 253 | 2 PROJECT FUNDING REQUIREMENTSTotal funding requirements and periodic funding requirements (e.g., quarterly, annually) are derived from the costbaseline. The cost baseline will include projected expenditures plus anticipated liabilities. Funding often occurs inincremental amounts, and may not be evenly distributed, which appear as steps in Figure 79. The total funds requiredare those included in the cost baseline plus management reserves, if any. Funding requirements may include thesource(s) of the funding. | 3 PROJECT DOCUMENTS UPDATESProject documents that may be updated as a result of carrying out this process include but are not !.7ic to: Cost estimates.

The key benefit of this process is that the cos‘ Luseline is maintained throughout the project. Thisprocess is performed throughout the project. The inputs, tcsls aid cechniques, and outputs of this process are depictedin Figure 710. Figure 711 depicts the data flow diagram ef cne process.254 Projectcharter255Updating the budget requires knowledge of the actual costs spent to date. Any increase to the authorized budget cannly be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Monitoring the expenditure offunds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project, otherthan to track the outflow of funds. Much of the effort of cost control involves analyzing the relationship between theconsumption of project funds and the work being accomplished for such expenditures. The key to effective cost controlis the management of the approved cost baseline.Project cost control includes: Influencing the factors that create changes to the authorized cost baseline; Ensuring that all change requests are acted on in a timely manner; Managing the actual changes when and as they occur; Ensuring that cost expenditures do not exceed the authorized funding by period, by WBS component, by activity,and in total for the project; Monitoring cost performance to isolate and understand variances from the approved cost baseline; Monitoring work performance against funds expended; Preventing unapproved changes from being included in the reported cost or resource usage; Informing appropriate stakeholders of all approved changes and associated cost; and Bringing expected cost overruns within acceptable limits.7.4.1 CONTROL COSTS: INPUTS | 1 PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLANDescribed in Section 4.2.3.1.

Examples of expert judgment during the Control Costs process include but are notlimited to: Variance analysis, Earned value analysis, Forecasting, and Financial analysis.257 | 2 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used to control costs include but are not limited to: Earned value analysis (EVA). Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to theactual schedule and cost performance. EVM integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedulebaseline to form the performance measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors three key dimensions foreach work package and control account: Planned value. Planned value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the authorizedbudget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure (WBS) component,not including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a givenpoint in time, planned value defines the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of thePY is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total planned value for theproject is also known as budget at completion (BAC). Earned value. Earned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorizedfor that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The EV beingeasured needs to be related to the PMB, and the EV measured cannot be greater than the authorizedPV budget for a component. The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progresseasurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Projectanagers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the longterm performance trends.Actual cost. Actual cost (AC) is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during aspecific time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The ACneeds to correspond in definition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., direct hoursnly, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spentto achieve the EV will be measured.258 Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis, as used in EVM, is the explanation (cause,impact, and corrective actions) for cost (CV EV  AC), schedule (SV EV  PV), and variance at completion(VAC BAC  EAC) variances. Cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements.For projects not using formal earned value analysis, similar variance analyses can be performed by comparingplanned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance.Further analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedulebaseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed. Cost performance measurements are used to assessthe magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline. An important aspect of project cost control includesdetermining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline (see Section  | 1) and decidingwhether corrective or preventive action is required. The percentage range of acceptable variances will tend todecrease as more work is accomplished. Examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to: Schedule variance. Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the differencebetween the earned value and the planned value. It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behindthe planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on a project. Itis equal to the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The EVA schedule variance is a useful metricin that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. The EVA schedulevariance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will havebeen earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method (CPM) scheduling andrisk management. Equation: SV EV  PV.Cost variance. Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget deficit or surplus at a given point in time, expressedas the difference between earned value and the actual cost. It isa measure of cost performance on a project.It is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC). The cost variance at the end of the project willbe the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the actual amount spent. The CV is particularlycritical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative CV is oftendifficult for the project to recover. Equation: CV EV  AC.259 Schedule performance index. The schedule performance index (SPI) is a measure of schedule efficiencyexpressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value. It measures how efficiently the project team isaccomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index (CPI) to forecastthe final project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed thanwas planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since theSPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determinewhether the project will finish ahead of or behind its planned finish date. The SPI is equal to the ratio of theEV to the PV. Equation: SPI EV/PV.Cost performance index. The cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost efficiency of budgetedresources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVA metricand measures the cost efficiency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrunfor work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The CPI isequal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: CPI EV/AC. Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determineif performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understandingperformance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of BAC versus estimate atcompletion (EAC) and completion dates. Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to:Charts. In earned value analysis, three parameters of planned value, earned value, and actual cost can benitored and reported on both a periodbyperiod basis (typically weekly or monthly) and on a cumulativebasis. Figure 712 uses Scurves to display EV data for a project that is performing over budget and behindthe schedule.260 Forecasting. As the project progresses, the project team may develop a forecast for the estimate at completion(EAC) that may differ from the budget at completion (BAC) based on the project performance. If it becomesbvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Forecastingthe EAC involves making projections of conditions and events in the project’s future based on currentperformance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are generated,updated, and reissued based on work performance data (Section 4.3.3.2) that is provided as the project isexecuted. The work performance information covers the project’s past performance and any information thatcould impact the project in the future.EACs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed, plus an estimate to complete (ETC)the remaining work. It is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the ETC,based on its experience to date. Earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of therequired EAC costs. The most common EAC forecasting approach is a manual, bottomup summation by theproject manager and project team.The project manager’s bottomup EAC method builds upon the actual costs and experience incurred forthe work completed, and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. Equation: EAC =AC + Bottomup ETC.261The project manager’s manual EAC is quickly compared with a range of calculated EACs representingvarious risk scenarios. When calculating EAC values, the cumulative CPI and SPI values are typicallyused. While EVM data quickly provide many statistical EACs, only three of the more common methods aredescribed as follows: EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted rate. This EAC method accepts the actual projectperformance to date (whether favorable or unfavorable) as represented by the actual costs, and predictsthat all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. When actual performance is unfavorable,the assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when supported by projectrisk analysis. Equation: EAC AC + (BAC  EV).. EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present CPI. This method assumes that what the project hasexperienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. The ETC work is assumed to be performedat the same cumulative cost performance index (CPI) as that incurred by the project to date. Equation:EAC BAC / CPI. EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI factors. In this forecast, the ETC work will beperformed at an efficiency rate that considers both the cost and schedule performance indices. Thisethod is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort. Variations of thisethod weight the CPI and SPI at different values (e.g., 80/20, 50/50, or some other ratio) according tothe project manager’s judgment. Equation: EAC AC + [(BAC  EV) / (CPI x SPI)]. Reserve analysis. Described in Section  | 6. During cost control, reserve analysis is used to monitor thestatus of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed orif additional reserves need to be requested. As work on the project progresses, these reserves may be used asplanned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. Conversely, when opportunities are capturedand resulting in cost savings, funds may be added to the contingency amount, or taken from the project asargin/profit.If the identified risks do not occur, the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget tofree up resources for other projects or operations. Additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a needto request that additional reserves be added to the project budget.262 | 3 TOCOMPLETE PERFORMANCE INDEXThe tocomplete performance index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved withthe remaining resources in order to meet a specified management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to finishthe outstanding work to the remaining budget. TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved on theremaining work to meet a specified management goal, such as the BAC or the EAC. If it becomes obvious that the BACis no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace cheBAC in the TCPI calculation. The equation for the TCP! based on the BAC: (BAC  EV) / (BAC  AC).The TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 713. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower left a. th: workremaining (defined as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which can be either ti.e CAC ininus theAC, or the EAC minus the AC).If the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 713), all future work of .5 project will needto be performed immediately in the range of the TCPI (BAC) (as reflected in the top ‘ine o: Figure 713) to staywithin the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgriet atl based on a number ofconsiderations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and technical pe.tor nate. This level of performanceis displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for the TCPI is based on the EAx: (BAC  EV) / (EAC  AC). The EVMformulas are provided in Table 71.263264  | 4 PROJECT MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PMIS)Described in Section 4.3.2.2.

The key benefit of this process is that it provides guidance and direction on how the projectcosts will be managed throughout the project. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project. Theinputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 72. Figure 73 depicts the data flowdiagram of the process.235The cost management planning effort occurs early in project planning and sets the framework for each of the costanagement processes so that performance of the processes will be efficient and coordinated.

       " ' 1. COST MANAGEMENT PLANThe cost management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how the project costs willbe planned, structured, and controlled. The cost management processes and their associated tools and techniques aredocumented in the cost management plan.For example, the cost management plan can establish the following: Units of measure. Each unit used in measurements (such as staff hours, staff days, or weeks for time measures;eters, liters, tons, kilometers, or cubic yards for quantity measures; or lump sum in currency form) is definedfor each of the resources. Level of precision. This is the degree to which cost estimates will be rounded up or down (e.g., US$995.59 toUS$1,000), based on the scope of the activities and magnitude of the project. Level of accuracy. The acceptable range (e.g., +10%) used in determining realistic cost estimates is specified,and may include an amount for contingencies.238  Organizational procedures links. The work breakdown structure (WBS) (Section 5.4) provides theframework for the cost management plan, allowing for consistency with the estimates, budgets, and controlf costs. The WBS component used for the project cost accounting is called the control account. Eachcontrol account is assigned a unique code or account number(s) that links directly to the performingrganization’s accounting system. Control thresholds. Variance thresholds for monitoring cost performance may be specified to indicate anagreedupon amount of variation to be allowed before some action needs to be taken. Thresholds are typicallyexpressed as percentage deviations from the baseline plan. Rules of performance measurement. Earned value management (EVM) rules of performance measurement areset. For example, the cost management plan may: Define the points in the WBS at which measurement of control accounts will be performed; Establish the EVM techniques (e.g., weighted milestones, fixedformula, percent complete, etc.) to beemployed; and Specify tracking methodologies and the EVM computation equations for calculating projected estimate atcompletion (EAC) forecasts to provide a validity check on the bottomup EAC. Reporting formats. The formats and frequency for the various cost reports are defined. Additional details. Additional details about cost management activities include but are not limited to: Description of strategic funding choices, Procedure to account for fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and Procedure for project cost recording.For more specific information regarding earned value management, refer to the Practice Standard for Earned ValueManagement  Second Edition [17].7.2 ESTIMATE COSTSEstimate Costs is the process of developing an approximation of the cost of resources needed to complete projectwork. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the monetary resources required for the project. This processis performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this processare depicted in Figure 74. Figure 75 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.239A cost estimate is a quantitative assessment of the likely costs for resources required to complete the activity. It is aprediction that is based on the information known at a given point in time. Cost estimates include the identification andconsideration of costing alternatives to initiate and complete the project. Cost tradeoffs and risks should be considered,such as make versus buy, buy versus lease, and the sharing of resources in order to achieve optimal costs for the project.Cost estimates are generally expressed in units of some currency (i.e., dollars, euros, yen, etc.), although in someinstances other units of measure, such as staff hours or staff days, are used to facilitate comparisons by eliminating theeffects of currency fluctuations.Cost estimates should be reviewed and refined during the course of the project to reflect additional detail as it becomesavailable and assumptions are tested. The accuracy of a project estimate will increase as the project progresses throughthe project life cycle. For example, a project in the initiation phase may have a rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimatein the range of 25% to +75%. Later in the project, as more information is known, definitive estimates could narrowthe range of accuracy to 5% to +10%. In some organizations, there are guidelines for when such refinements can beade and the degree of confidence or accuracy that is expected.Costs are estimated for all resources that will be charged to the project. This includes but is not limited to labor,aterials, equipment, services, and facilities, as well as special categories such as an inflation allowance, cost offinancing, or contingency costs. Cost estimates may be presented at the activity level or in summary form.7.2.1 ESTIMATE COSTS: INPUTS ',\n",

The duration estimates (Section 6.4.3.1) willaffect cost estimates when resources are charged per unit of time and when there are seasonal fluctuationsin costs. The schedule also provides useful information for projects that incorporate the cost of financing(including interest charges). Resource requirements. Described in Section 9.2.3.1. Resource requirements identify the types and quantitiesf resources required for each work package or activity. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register contains details of individual project risks thathave been identified and prioritized, and for which risk responses are required.

Values and attributes of the projects may include but are not limited to: scope, cost, budget,duration, and measures of scale (e.g., size, weight). Comparison of these project values, or attributes, becomes the basisfor estimating the same parameter or measurement for the current project. ',\n",

Parametric estimating uses a statistical relationship between relevant historical dataand other variables (e.g., square footage in construction) to calculate a cost estimate for project work. This technique canproduce higher levels of accuracy depending on the sophistication and underlying data built into the model. Parametriccost estimates can be applied to a total project or to segments of a project, in conjunction with other estimating methods. ',\n",
       " ' 4 BOTTOMUP ESTIMATINGDescribed in Section 6.4.2.5. Bottomup estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The costf individual work packages or activities is estimated to the greatest level of specified detail. The detailed costis then summarized or “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. The cost andaccuracy of bottomup cost estimating are typically influenced by the size or other attributes of the individualactivity or work package. ',\n",
       " ' 5 THREEPOINT ESTIMATINGDescribed in Section 6.4.2.4. The accuracy of singlepoint cost estimates may be improved by considering estimationuncertainty and risk and using three estimates to define an approximate range for an activity’s cost: Most likely (cM). The cost of the activity, based on realistic effort assessment for the required work and anypredicted expenses. Optimistic (cO). The cost based on analysis of the bestcase scenario for the activity. Pessimistic (cP). The cost based on analysis of the worstcase scenario for the activity.243Depending on the assumed distribution of values within the range of the three estimates, the expected cost, cE, canbe calculated using a formula. Two commonly used formulas are triangular and beta distributions. The formulas are: Triangular distribution. cE (cO + cM + cP) / 3 Beta distribution. cE (CO + 4cM + cP) / 6Cost estimates based on three points with an assumed distribution provide an expected cost and clarify the range ofuncertainty around the expected cost.

Alternatives analysis is a technique used to evaluate identified options in order to selectwhich options or approaches to use to execute and perform the work of the project. An example would beevaluating the cost, schedule, resource, and quality impacts of buying versus making a deliverable. Reserve analysis. Cost estimates may include contingency reserves (sometimes called contingency allowances)to account for cost uncertainty. Contingency reserves are the budget within the cost baseline that is allocated foridentified risks. Contingency reserves are often viewed as the part of the budget intended to address the knownunknowns that can affect a project. For example, rework for some project deliverables could be anticipated, whilethe amount of this rework is unknown. Contingency reserves may be estimated to account for this unknownamount of rework. Contingency reserves can be provided at any level from the specific activity to the entireproject. The contingency reserve may be a percentage of the estimated cost, a fixed number, or may be developedby using quantitative analysis methods.As more precise information about the project becomes available, the contingency reserve may be used, reduced,r eliminated. Contingency should be clearly identified in cost documentation. Contingency reserves are part ofthe cost baseline and the overall funding requirements for the project. Cost of quality. Assumptions about costs of quality (Section 8.1.2.3) may be used to prepare the estimates. Thisincludes evaluating the cost impact of additional investment in conformance versus the cost of nonconformance.It can also include looking at shortterm cost reductions versus the implication of more frequent problems latern in the product life cycle.244  ',\n",

Any increase to the authorized budget cannly be approved through the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.6). Monitoring the expenditure offunds without regard to the value of work being accomplished for such expenditures has little value to the project, otherthan to track the outflow of funds.

       " ' 2 DATA ANALYSISData analysis techniques that can be used to control costs include but are not limited to: Earned value analysis (EVA). Earned value analysis compares the performance measurement baseline to theactual schedule and cost performance. EVM integrates the scope baseline with the cost baseline and schedulebaseline to form the performance measurement baseline. EVM develops and monitors three key dimensions foreach work package and control account: Planned value. Planned value (PV) is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. It is the authorizedbudget planned for the work to be accomplished for an activity or work breakdown structure (WBS) component,not including management reserve. This budget is allocated by phase over the life of the project, but at a givenpoint in time, planned value defines the physical work that should have been accomplished. The total of thePY is sometimes referred to as the performance measurement baseline (PMB). The total planned value for theproject is also known as budget at completion (BAC). Earned value. Earned value (EV) is a measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorizedfor that work. It is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The EV beingeasured needs to be related to the PMB, and the EV measured cannot be greater than the authorizedPV budget for a component. The EV is often used to calculate the percent complete of a project. Progresseasurement criteria should be established for each WBS component to measure work in progress. Projectanagers monitor EV, both incrementally to determine current status and cumulatively to determine the longterm performance trends.Actual cost. Actual cost (AC) is the realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during aspecific time period. It is the total cost incurred in accomplishing the work that the EV measured. The ACneeds to correspond in definition to what was budgeted in the PV and measured in the EV (e.g., direct hoursnly, direct costs only, or all costs including indirect costs). The AC will have no upper limit; whatever is spentto achieve the EV will be measured.258 Variance analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Variance analysis, as used in EVM, is the explanation (cause,impact, and corrective actions) for cost (CV EV  AC), schedule (SV EV  PV), and variance at completion(VAC BAC  EAC) variances. Cost and schedule variances are the most frequently analyzed measurements.For projects not using formal earned value analysis, similar variance analyses can be performed by comparingplanned cost against actual cost to identify variances between the cost baseline and actual project performance.Further analysis can be performed to determine the cause and degree of variance relative to the schedulebaseline and any corrective or preventive actions needed. Cost performance measurements are used to assessthe magnitude of variation to the original cost baseline. An important aspect of project cost control includesdetermining the cause and degree of variance relative to the cost baseline (see Section  ',\n",
       " ' 1) and decidingwhether corrective or preventive action is required. The percentage range of acceptable variances will tend todecrease as more work is accomplished. Examples of variance analysis include but are not limited to: Schedule variance. Schedule variance (SV) is a measure of schedule performance expressed as the differencebetween the earned value and the planned value. It is the amount by which the project is ahead or behindthe planned delivery date, at a given point in time. It is a measure of schedule performance on a project. Itis equal to the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The EVA schedule variance is a useful metricin that it can indicate when a project is falling behind or is ahead of its baseline schedule. The EVA schedulevariance will ultimately equal zero when the project is completed because all of the planned values will havebeen earned. Schedule variance is best used in conjunction with critical path method (CPM) scheduling andrisk management. Equation: SV EV  PV.Cost variance. Cost variance (CV) is the amount of budget deficit or surplus at a given point in time, expressedas the difference between earned value and the actual cost. It isa measure of cost performance on a project.It is equal to the earned value (EV) minus the actual cost (AC). The cost variance at the end of the project willbe the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the actual amount spent. The CV is particularlycritical because it indicates the relationship of physical performance to the costs spent. Negative CV is oftendifficult for the project to recover. Equation: CV EV  AC.259 Schedule performance index. The schedule performance index (SPI) is a measure of schedule efficiencyexpressed as the ratio of earned value to planned value. It measures how efficiently the project team isaccomplishing the work. It is sometimes used in conjunction with the cost performance index (CPI) to forecastthe final project completion estimates. An SPI value less than 1.0 indicates less work was completed thanwas planned. An SPI greater than 1.0 indicates that more work was completed than was planned. Since theSPI measures all project work, the performance on the critical path also needs to be analyzed to determinewhether the project will finish ahead of or behind its planned finish date. The SPI is equal to the ratio of theEV to the PV. Equation: SPI EV/PV.Cost performance index. The cost performance index (CPI) is a measure of the cost efficiency of budgetedresources, expressed as a ratio of earned value to actual cost. It is considered the most critical EVA metricand measures the cost efficiency for the work completed. A CPI value of less than 1.0 indicates a cost overrunfor work completed. A CPI value greater than 1.0 indicates a cost underrun of performance to date. The CPI isequal to the ratio of the EV to the AC. Equation: CPI EV/AC. Trend analysis. Described in Section 4.5.2.2. Trend analysis examines project performance over time to determineif performance is improving or deteriorating. Graphical analysis techniques are valuable for understandingperformance to date and for comparison to future performance goals in the form of BAC versus estimate atcompletion (EAC) and completion dates. Examples of the trend analysis techniques include but are not limited to:Charts. In earned value analysis, three parameters of planned value, earned value, and actual cost can benitored and reported on both a periodbyperiod basis (typically weekly or monthly) and on a cumulativebasis. Figure 712 uses Scurves to display EV data for a project that is performing over budget and behindthe schedule.260 Forecasting. As the project progresses, the project team may develop a forecast for the estimate at completion(EAC) that may differ from the budget at completion (BAC) based on the project performance. If it becomesbvious that the BAC is no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Forecastingthe EAC involves making projections of conditions and events in the project’s future based on currentperformance information and other knowledge available at the time of the forecast. Forecasts are generated,updated, and reissued based on work performance data (Section 4.3.3.2) that is provided as the project isexecuted. The work performance information covers the project’s past performance and any information thatcould impact the project in the future.EACs are typically based on the actual costs incurred for work completed, plus an estimate to complete (ETC)the remaining work. It is incumbent on the project team to predict what it may encounter to perform the ETC,based on its experience to date. Earned value analysis works well in conjunction with manual forecasts of therequired EAC costs. The most common EAC forecasting approach is a manual, bottomup summation by theproject manager and project team.The project manager’s bottomup EAC method builds upon the actual costs and experience incurred forthe work completed, and requires a new estimate to complete the remaining project work. Equation: EAC =AC + Bottomup ETC.261The project manager’s manual EAC is quickly compared with a range of calculated EACs representingvarious risk scenarios. When calculating EAC values, the cumulative CPI and SPI values are typicallyused. While EVM data quickly provide many statistical EACs, only three of the more common methods aredescribed as follows: EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the budgeted rate. This EAC method accepts the actual projectperformance to date (whether favorable or unfavorable) as represented by the actual costs, and predictsthat all future ETC work will be accomplished at the budgeted rate. When actual performance is unfavorable,the assumption that future performance will improve should be accepted only when supported by projectrisk analysis. Equation: EAC AC + (BAC  EV).. EAC forecast for ETC work performed at the present CPI. This method assumes that what the project hasexperienced to date can be expected to continue in the future. The ETC work is assumed to be performedat the same cumulative cost performance index (CPI) as that incurred by the project to date. Equation:EAC BAC / CPI. EAC forecast for ETC work considering both SPI and CPI factors. In this forecast, the ETC work will beperformed at an efficiency rate that considers both the cost and schedule performance indices. Thisethod is most useful when the project schedule is a factor impacting the ETC effort. Variations of thisethod weight the CPI and SPI at different values (e.g., 80/20, 50/50, or some other ratio) according tothe project manager’s judgment. Equation: EAC AC + [(BAC  EV) / (CPI x SPI)]. Reserve analysis. Described in Section  ',\n",
       " ' 6. During cost control, reserve analysis is used to monitor thestatus of contingency and management reserves for the project to determine if these reserves are still needed orif additional reserves need to be requested. As work on the project progresses, these reserves may be used asplanned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. Conversely, when opportunities are capturedand resulting in cost savings, funds may be added to the contingency amount, or taken from the project asargin/profit.If the identified risks do not occur, the unused contingency reserves may be removed from the project budget tofree up resources for other projects or operations. Additional risk analysis during the project may reveal a needto request that additional reserves be added to the project budget.262 ',\n",
       " ' 3 TOCOMPLETE PERFORMANCE INDEXThe tocomplete performance index (TCPI) is a measure of the cost performance that is required to be achieved withthe remaining resources in order to meet a specified management goal, expressed as the ratio of the cost to finishthe outstanding work to the remaining budget. TCPI is the calculated cost performance index that is achieved on theremaining work to meet a specified management goal, such as the BAC or the EAC. If it becomes obvious that the BACis no longer viable, the project manager should consider the forecasted EAC. Once approved, the EAC may replace cheBAC in the TCPI calculation. The equation for the TCP! based on the BAC: (BAC  EV) / (BAC  AC).The TCPI is conceptually displayed in Figure 713. The equation for the TCPI is shown in the lower left a. th: workremaining (defined as the BAC minus the EV) divided by the funds remaining (which can be either ti.e CAC ininus theAC, or the EAC minus the AC).If the cumulative CPI falls below the baseline (as shown in Figure 713), all future work of .5 project will needto be performed immediately in the range of the TCPI (BAC) (as reflected in the top ‘ine o: Figure 713) to staywithin the authorized BAC. Whether this level of performance is achievable is a judgriet atl based on a number ofconsiderations, including risk, time remaining in the project, and technical pe.tor nate. This level of performanceis displayed as the TCPI (EAC) line. The equation for the TCPI is based on the EAx: (BAC  EV) / (EAC  AC). The EVMformulas are provided in Table 71.263264  ',\n",

During the Cost Estimates process, new assumptions may beade, new constraints may be identified, and existing assumptions or constraints may be revisited and changed.The assumption log should be updated with this new information. Lessons learned register. Described in Section 4.4.3.1. The lessons learned register can be updated withtechniques that were efficient and effective in developing cost estimates. Risk register. Described in Section 11.2.3.1. The risk register may be updated when appropriate risk responsesare chosen and agreed upon during the Estimate Cost process.7.3 DETERMINE BUDGETDetermine Budget is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages toestablish an authorized cost baseline. The key benefit of this process is that it determines the cost baseline againstwhich project performance can be monitored and controlled. This process is performed once or at predefined points inthe project. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 76. Figure 77 depictsthe data flow diagram of the process.A project budget includes all the funds authorized to execute the project. The cost baseline is the approved version ofthe timephased project budget that includes contingency reserves, but excludes management reserves.246 Projectcharter2477.3.1 DETERMINE BUDGET: INPUTS '"
