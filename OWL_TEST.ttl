<http://example.org/projectOntology/5.2.2_COLLECT_REQUIREMENTS:_TOOLS_AND_TECHNIQUES_> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#isDefinedBy> "  PROTOTYPES  Prototyping is a method of obtaining early feedback on requirements by providing a model of the expected product before actually building it. Examples of prototypes are smallscale products, computer generated 2D and 3D models,ockups, or simulations. Prototypes allow stakeholders to experiment with a model of the final product rather than being limited to discussing abstract representations of their requirements. Prototypes support the concept of progressive elaboration in iterative cycles of mockup creation, user experimentation, feedback generation, and prototype revision. When enough feedback cycles have been performed, the requirements obtained from the prototype are sufficiently complete to move to a design or build phase.  Storyboarding is a prototyping technique showing sequence or navigation through a series of images or illustrations. Storyboards are used on a variety of projects in a variety of industries, such as film, advertising, instructional design, and on agile and other software development projects. In software development, storyboards use mockups to show navigation paths through web pages, screens, or other user interfaces.  5.2.3 COLLECT REQUIREMENTS: OUTPUTS   "^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Voting is a collective decisionmaking technique and an assessment process having multiple alternatives with an expected outcome in the form of future actions. These techniques can be used to generate, classify, and prioritize product requirements. Examples of voting techniques include: _ Unanimity. A decision that is reached whereby everyone agrees on a single course of action.  Majority. A decision that is reached with support obtained from more than 50% of the members of the group. Having a group size with an uneven number of participants can ensure that a decision will be reached, rather than resulting in a tie.  Plurality. A decision that is reached whereby the largest block in a group decides, even if a majority is not achieved. This method is generally used when the number of options nominated is more than two.   Autocratic decision making. In this method, one individual takes responsibility for making the decision for the group.   Multicriteria decision analysis. A technique that uses a decision matrix to provide a systematic analytical approach for establishing criteria, such as risk levels, uncertainty, and valuation, to evaluate and rank many ideas.

According to Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide [7], some organizations refer to it as a business analysis plan. Components of the requirementsanagement plan can include but are not limited to:   How requirements activities will be planned, tracked, and reported;   Configuration management activities such as: how changes will be initiated; how impacts will be analyzed; how they will be traced, tracked, and reported; as well as the authorization levels required to approve these changes;   Requirements prioritization process;  Metrics that will be used and the rationale for using them; and   Traceability structure that reflects the requirement attributes captured on the traceability matrix.  137 5.2 COLLECT REQUIREMENTS  Collect Requirements is the process of determining, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs and requirements to meet objectives. The key benefit of this process is that it provides the basis for defining the product scope and project scope. This process is performed once or at predefined points in the project.

Note that Business Analysis for Practitioners: A Practice Guide [7] provides more indepth information about product requirements. The project’s success is directly influenced by active stakeholder involvement in the discovery and decomposition of needs into project and product requirements and by the care taken in determining, documenting, and managing the requirements of the product, service, or result of the project. Requirements include conditions or capabilities that are required to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed specification. Requirements include the quantified and documented needs and expectations of the sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders. These requirements need to be elicited, analyzed, and recorded in enough detail to be included in the scope baseline and to be measured once project execution begins. Requirements become the foundation of the WBS. Cost, schedule, quality planning, and procurement are all based on these requirements.  5.2.1 COLLECT REQUIREMENTS: INPUTS   "^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

The project scope statement documents the entire scope, including project and product scope. It describes the project’s deliverables in detail. It also provides a common understanding of the project scope among project stakeholders. It may contain explicit scope exclusions that can assist in managing stakeholder expectations. It enables the project team to perform more detailed planning, guides the project team’s work during execution, and provides the baseline for evaluating whether requests for changes or additional work are contained within or outside the projects boundaries.  The degree and level of detail to which the project scope statement defines the work that will be performed and the work that is excluded can help determine how well the project management team can control the overall project scope. The detailed project scope statement, either directly or by reference to other documents, includes the following:   Product scope description. Progressively elaborates the characteristics of the product, service, or result described in the project charter and requirements documentation.   Deliverables. Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project. Deliverables also include ancillary results, such as project management reports and documentation. These deliverables may be described at a summary levelr in great detail.   Acceptance criteria. A set of conditions that is required to be met before deliverables are accepted.   Project exclusions. Identifies what is excluded from the project. Explicitly stating what is out of scope for the project helps manage stakeholders’ expectations and can reduce scope creep.  Although the project charter and the project scope statement are sometimes perceived as containing a certain degree of redundancy, they are different in the level of detail contained in each. The project charter contains high level information, while the project scope statement contains a detailed description of the scope components. These components are progressively elaborated throughout the project. Table 51 describes some of the key elements for each document.  154  Table 51.

The implementation of a requirements traceability matrix helps ensure that each requirement adds business value by linking it to the business and project objectives. It provides a means to track requirements throughout the project life cycle, helping to ensure that requirements approved in the requirements documentation are delivered at the end of the project. Finally, it provides a structure for managing changes to the product scope.  148  Tracing requirements includes but is not limited to:  Business needs, opportunities, goals, and objectives;  Project objectives;  Project scope and WBS deliverables;  Product design;  Product development;  Test strategy and test scenarios; and  Highlevel requirements to more detailed requirements.  Attributes associated with each requirement can be recorded in the requirements traceability matrix. These attributes help to define key information about the requirement. Typical attributes used in the requirements traceabilityatrix may include: a unique identifier, a textual description of the requirement, the rationale for inclusion, owner, source, priority, version, current status (such as active, cancelled, deferred, added, approved, assigned, completed), and status date. Additional attributes to ensure that the requirement has met stakeholders’ satisfaction may include stability, complexity, and acceptance criteria. Figure 57 provides an example of a requirements traceability matrix with its associated attributes.

Define Scope: Data Flow Diagram  Since all the requirements identified in Collect Requirements may not be included in the project, the Define Scope process selects the final project requirements from the requirements documentation developed during the Collect Requirements process. It then develops a detailed description of the project and product, service, or result.  The preparation of a detailed project scope statement builds upon the major deliverables, assumptions, and constraints that are documented during project initiation. During project planning, the project scope is defined and described with greater specificity as more information about the project is known. Existing risks, assumptions, and constraints are analyzed for completeness and added or updated as necessary. The Define Scope process can be highly iterative. In iterative life cycle projects, a highlevel vision will be developed for the overall project, but the detailed scope is determined one iteration at a time, and the detailed planning for the next iteration is carried out as work progressesn the current project scope and deliverables.  151 5.3.1 DEFINE SCOPE: INPUTS   "^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Requirements may start out at a high level and become progressively more detailed as more information about the requirements is known. Before being baselined, requirements need to be unambiguous (measurable and testable), traceable, complete, consistent, and acceptable to key stakeholders. The format of the requirements document may range from a simple document listing all the requirements categorized by stakeholder and priority, to more elaborate forms containing an executive summary, detailed descriptions, and attachments.  147 Many organizations categorize requirements into different types, such as business and technical solutions, the former referring to stakeholder needs and the latter as to how those needs will be implemented. Requirements can be grouped into classifications allowing for further refinement and detail as the requirements are elaborated. These Classifications include:   Business requirements. These describe the higherlevel needs of the organization as a whole, such as the business issues or opportunities, and reasons why a project has been undertaken.   Stakeholder requirements. These describe needs of a stakeholder or stakeholder group.   Solution requirements. These describe features, functions, and characteristics of the product, service, or result that will meet the business and stakeholder requirements. Solution requirements are further grouped into functional and nonfunctional requirements:  Functional requirements. Functional requirements describe the behaviors of the product. Examples include actions, processes, data, and interactions that the product should execute.  Nonfunctional requirements. Nonfunctional requirements supplement functional requirements and describe the environmental conditions or qualities required for the product to be effective. Examples include: reliability, security, performance, safety, level of service, supportability, retention/purge, etc.   Transition and readiness requirements. These describe temporary capabilities, such as data conversion and training requirements, needed to transition from the current asis state to the desired future state.   Project requirements. These describe the actions, processes, or other conditions the project needs to meet. Examples include milestone dates, contractual obligations, constraints, etc.   Quality requirements. These capture any condition or criteria needed to validate the successful completionf a project deliverable or fulfillment of other project requirements. Examples include tests, certifications, validations, etc.   "^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

<http://example.org/projectOntology/5.4_CREATE_WBS_> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#isDefinedBy> "  DECOMPOSITION  Decomposition is a technique used for dividing and subdividing the project scope and project deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts. The work package is the work defined at the lowest level of the WBS for which cost and duration can be estimated and managed. The level of decomposition is often guided by the degree of control needed to effectively manage the project. The level of detail for work packages will vary with the size and complexity of the project. Decomposition of the total project work into work packages generally involves the following activities:   Identifying and analyzing the deliverables and related work,   Structuring and organizing the WBS,   Decomposing the upper WBS levels into lowerlevel detailed components,  Developing and assigning identification codes to the WBS components, and  Verifying that the degree of decomposition of the deliverables is appropriate.  A portion of a WBS with some branches of the WBS decomposed down through the work package level is shown in Figure 512.  1.0 Value Management System Project  11 1.2 13 14 Needs Standards Systems Project Assessment Development Engineering Management  144 1.1.2 11.3 As Current System Requirements Alternatives System Requirements Audit Determination Development Development  1444 11.24 11.3.4 Components Gap Alternatives Identification Assessment Identification  11.1.2 11.2.2 113.2 Components Requirements Alternatives Analysis Changes Identification Analysis  The WBS is illustrative only. It is not intended to represent the full project scope of any specific project, nor to imply that this is the only way to organize a WBS on this type of project.  Figure 512. Sample WBS Decomposed Down Through Work Packages  158  A WBS structure may be created through various approaches. Some of the popular methods include the topdown approach, the use of organizationspecific guidelines, and the use of WBS templates. A bottomup approach can be used to group subcomponents. The WBS structure can be represented in a number of forms, such as:   Using phases of the project life cycle as the second level of decomposition, with the product and project deliverables inserted at the third level, as shown in Figure 513;   Using major deliverables as the second level of decomposition, as shown in Figure 514; and   Incorporating subcomponents that may be developed by organizations outside the project team, such as contracted work. The seller then develops the supporting contract WBS as part of the contracted work.

Sample WBS with Major Deliverables  Decomposition of the upperlevel WBS components requires subdividing the work for each of the deliverables or subcomponents into its most fundamental components, where the WBS components represent verifiable products, services,r results. If an agile approach is used, epics can be decomposed into user stories. The WBS may be structured as anutline, an organizational chart, or other method that identifies a hierarchical breakdown. Verifying the correctness of the decomposition requires determining that the lowerlevel WBS components are those that are necessary and sufficient for completion of the corresponding higherlevel deliverables. Different deliverables can have different levels of decomposition. To arrive at a work package, the work for some deliverables needs to be decomposed only to the next level, while others need additional levels of decomposition. As the work is decomposed to greater levels of detail, the ability to plan, manage, and control the work is enhanced. However, excessive decomposition can lead to nonproductive management effort, inefficient use of resources, decreased efficiency in performing the work, and difficulty aggregating data over different levels of the WBS.  Decomposition may not be possible for a deliverable or subcomponent that will be accomplished far into the future. The project management team usually waits until the deliverable or subcomponent is agreed on, so the details of the WBS can be developed. This technique is sometimes referred to as rolling wave planning.  160  The WBS represents all product and project work, including the project management work. The total of the work at the lowest levels should roll up to the higher levels so that nothing is left out and no extra work is performed. This is sometimes called the 100 percent rule.  For specific information regarding the WBS, refer to the Practice Standard for Work Breakdown Structures — Second Edition [15]. This standard contains industryspecific examples of WBS templates that can be tailored to specific projects in a particular application area.  5.4.3 CREATE WBS: OUTPUTS   "^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string> .

Requirements documentation may be updated  to include approved changes resulting from the Create WBS process.  162   5.5 VALIDATE SCOPE  Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. The key benefit of this process is that it brings objectivity to the acceptance process and increases the probability of final product, service,r result acceptance by validating each deliverable. This process is performed periodically throughout the project as needed. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 515. Figure 516 depicts  the data flow diagram of the process.

Validate Scope: Data Flow Diagram  Project Documents a  The verified deliverables obtained from the Control Quality process are reviewed with the customer or sponsor to ensure they are completed satisfactorily and have received formal acceptance of the deliverables by the customer or sponsor. In this process, the outputs obtained as a result of the Planning processes in the Project Scope Management Knowledge Area, such as the requirements documentation or the scope baseline, as well as the work performance databtained from the Execution processes in other Knowledge Areas, are the basis for performing the validation and for  final acceptance.  The Validate Scope process differs from the Control Quality process in that the former is primarily concerned with acceptance of the deliverables, while the latter is primarily concerned with correctness of the deliverables and meeting the quality requirements specified for the deliverables. Control Quality is generally performed before Validate Scope, although the two processes may be performed in parallel.  164   5.5.1 VALIDATE SCOPE: INPUTS  5.
